<br /> opening inventory means the finished goods inventory at the time an inventory <br /> management method is chosen; <br /> origin identifier means any mark that identifies fungible goods as originating goods or <br /> non-originating goods; and <br /> rolling average method means the method by which the origin of fungible goods <br /> withdrawn from finished goods inventory is based on the ratio, calculated under <br /> subsection 9, of originating goods and non-originating goods in finished goods inventory. <br /> Subsection 7: General <br /> 1 The inventory management methods for determining whether fungible goods <br /> referred to in Article 4.6(b) are originating goods are the following: <br /> (a) specific identification method; <br /> (b) FIFO method; <br /> (c) LIFO method; and <br /> (d) rolling average method. <br /> 2 When an exporter of a good or a person from whom the exporter acquired the <br /> good chooses an inventory management method referred to in paragraph 1, that method <br /> shall be used from the time the choice is made until the end of the fiscal year of the <br /> exporter or person. <br /> Subsection 8: Specific Identification Method <br /> 1 Except as provided under paragraph 2, if the exporter or person referred to in <br /> subsection 7(2) chooses the specific identification method, the exporter or person shall <br /> physically segregate, in finished goods inventory, originating goods that are fungible <br /> goods from non-originating goods that are fungible goods. <br /> 2 If originating goods or non-originating goods that are fungible goods are marked <br /> with an origin identifier, the exporter or person need not physically segregate those goods <br /> under paragraph 1 if the origin identifier is visible on the fungible goods. <br /> Subsection 9: Rolling Average Method <br /> 1 If the exporter or person referred to in subsection 7(2) chooses the rolling average <br /> method, the origin of each shipment of fungible goods withdrawn from finished goods <br /> inventory is determined on the basis of the ratio of originating goods and non-originating <br /> goods in finished goods inventory by dividing: <br /> (a) the total units of originating goods or non-originating goods that are <br /> fungible goods and that were in finished goods inventory before the <br /> shipment of the goods; by: <br /> (b) the total units of originating goods and non-originating goods that are <br /> fungible goods and that were in finished goods inventory before the <br /> shipment of the goods. <br /> 2 The ratio calculated under paragraph 1 is applied to the remaining units of <br /> originating and non-originating goods in finished goods inventory. <br /> Subsection 10: Manner of Dealing with Opening Inventory <br /> 1 Except as otherwise provided under paragraphs 2 and 3, when the exporter or <br /> person referred to in subsection 7(2) has fungible goods in opening inventory, the origin <br /> of those fungible goods is determined by: <br /> (a) identifying, in the books of the exporter or person, the latest receipts of <br /> fungible goods that add up to the amount of fungible goods in opening inventory; <br /> (b) determining the origin of those fungible goods that make up those receipts; and <br /> (c) considering the origin of those fungible goods to be the origin of the <br /> fungible goods in opening inventory. <br /> 2 If the exporter or person chooses the specific identification method and has, in <br /> opening inventory, originating goods or non-originating goods that are fungible goods <br /> and that are marked with an origin identifier, the origin of those fungible goods is <br /> determined on the basis of the origin identifier. <br /> 3 The exporter or person may consider all fungible goods in opening inventory to <br /> be non-originating goods.", "ProvisionValueCssClass": "", "ProvisionDisplayCssClass": null}, {"ProvisionAbbrev": "sets", "ProvisionCode": "Sets", "ProvisionValue": "included (RVC 50%)", "ProvisionRank": null, "ProvisionGlossary": "A provision that clarifies circumstances under which sets can be considered originating.

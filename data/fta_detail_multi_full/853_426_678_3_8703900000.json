They are not legally binding to State Parties.<br /> Note 2<br /> 2.1: The first two columns in the Appendix describe the Product obtained. The first column<br /> gives the Chapter, Heading or Sub-heading as it is used in the Harmonized System (HS).<br /> The second column gives the description of Goods as it is used in the HS for that Chapter,<br /> Heading or Sub-heading. For each entry in the first two columns a rule is specified in<br /> Column 3. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an \"ex\",<br /> this signifies that the rules in Column 3 apply only to the part of that Chapter, Heading or<br /> Sub-as described in Column 2.<br /> 2.2: Where a Chapter or several Headings are grouped together in Column 1 and the<br /> description of Products in Column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rules<br /> in Column 3 apply to all Products which, under the HS are classified in the Headings of<br /> the Chapter or in any of the Headings or Sub-headings grouped together in Column 1.<br /> 2.3: Where there are different rules in Column 3 applying to different within a Heading or<br /> Sub-Heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the Heading or Sub-<br /> heading covered by the adjacent rules in Column 3.<br /> 2.4: Where a Chapter, Heading or Sub-heading, in Column 1, or any text of this Appendix,<br /> is in square brackets that is an indication that the rule for that Chapter, Heading or Sub-<br /> heading in Column 3, or that text, is yet to be agreed by the AfCFTA Negotiating<br /> Institutions.<br /> 2.5: Where a Chapter, Heading or Sub-heading, in Column 1 has an asterisk, the value<br /> of non-originating materials will be automatically reduced from 60% to 55% threshold at<br /> the end of a five (5) year period starting 1 January 2021.<br /> Note 3<br /> 3.1: The provisions of Article 4(b) of Annex 2 on Rules of Origin concerning Products<br /> having acquired originating status which are used in the manufacture of other Products<br /> apply regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where these<br /> Products are used or in a factory in another State Party.<br /> Example 1: An engine of Heading 84.07, for which the rule may state that the<br /> value of non-originating Materials which may be incorporated may not exceed<br /> a certain percentage of the ex-works price, is made from \u2018other alloy steel<br /> roughly shaped by forging' of Heading ex 72.24.<br /> If this forging has been undertaken in a State Party from a non-originating<br /> ingot, it has already acquired originating status by virtue of the rule applicable<br /> to Products of HS Chapter 72 in this Appendix. The forging can then count as<br /> originating in the value calculation for the engine regardless of whether it was<br /> produced in the same factory or in another factory in another State Party. The<br /> value of the non-originating ingot is thus not taken into account when adding<br /> up the value of the non-originating Materials used.<br /> 3.2: The rule in Column 3 represents the minimum amount of working or processing<br /> required and the carrying out of more working or processing also confers originating<br /> status. Conversely, the carrying out of less working or processing cannot confer<br /> originating status. Thus if a rule provides that non-originating material at a certain level of<br /> manufacture may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is<br /> allowed and the use of such material at a later stage is not.<br /> 3.3: When a rule in Column 3 specifies that a Product may be manufactured from more<br /> than one material, this means that any one or more Materials may be used. It does not<br /> require that all the Materials listed must be used.<br /> Example 2: The rule for fabrics of Headings 52.08 to 52.12 provides that<br /> natural fibres may be used and that chemical Materials, among other Materials,<br /> may also be used. This does not mean that both have to be used; it is possible<br /> to use one or the other or both.<br /> 3.4: Where a rule in Column 3 specifies that a Product must be manufactured from a<br /> particular Material, the condition obviously does not prevent the use of other Materials<br /> which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule. (See also Note 6.2 below<br /> in relation to textiles).<br /> Example 3: In the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 made from<br /> non-woven Materials, if the use of only non-originating yarn is allowed for this<br /> class of article, it is not possible to start from non-woven cloth, even if non-<br /> woven cloths cannot normally be made from yarn. In such cases, the starting<br /> Material would normally be at the stage before yarn, that is, the fibre stage.<br /> \"SPECIFIC PROCESSES\"<br /> Note 4<br /> 4.1: For the purposes of Headings 27.07 and 27.13 the following are the \"specific<br /> processes\":<br /> a) vacuum distillation;<br /> b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;<br /> c) cracking;<br /> d) reforming;<br /> e) extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> f) the process comprising all the following operations: processing with<br /> concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation<br /> with alkaline agents; decolorisation and purification with naturally active<br /> earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;<br /> g) polymerisation;<br /> h) alkylation; and<br /> i) isomerisation.<br /> 4.2: For the purposes of Headings 27.10, 27.11 and 27.12, the following are the \u2018specific<br /> processes':<br /> a) vacuum distillation;<br /> b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process<br /> c) cracking;<br /> d) reforming;<br /> e) extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> f) the process comprising all the following operations: processing with<br /> concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation<br /> with alkaline agents; decolorisation and purification with naturally active<br /> earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;<br /> g) polymerisation;<br /> h) alkylation;<br /> i) isomerisation;<br /> j) in respect of heavy oils falling within Heading ex 27.10 only,<br /> desulphurisation with hydrogen resulting in a reduction of at least 85 per<br /> cent of the sulphur content of the Products processed (ASTM D 1266-59 T<br /> method);<br /> k) in respect of Products falling within Heading 27.10 only, deparaffining by a<br /> process other than filtering;<br /> l) in respect of heavy oils falling within Heading ex 27.10 only, treatment with<br /> hydrogen at a pressure of more than 20 bar and a temperature of more than<br /> 250 \u00b0C with the use of a catalyst, other than to effect desulphurisation, when<br /> the hydrogen constitutes an active element in a chemical reaction. The<br /> further treatment with hydrogen of lubricating oils of Heading ex 27.10 (e.g.<br /> hydrofinishing or decolorisation) in order, more especially, to improve colour<br /> or stability shall not, however, be deemed to be a specific process;<br /> m) in respect of fuel oils falling within Heading ex 27.10 only, atmospheric<br /> distillation, on condition that less than 30 per cent of these Products distils,<br /> by volume, including losses, at 300 \u00b0C by the ASTM D 86 method; and<br /> n) in respect of heavy oils other than gas oils and fuel oils falling within Heading<br /> ex 27.10 only, treatment by means of a high-frequency electrical brush-<br /> discharge.<br /> 4.3: For the purposes of Heading 27.07and 27.13 simple operations such as cleaning,<br /> decanting, desalting, water separation, filtering, colouring, marking, obtaining a sulphur<br /> content as a result of mixing Products with different sulphur contents, any combination of<br /> these operations or like operations do not confer origin.<br /> TEXTILES<br /> Note 5<br /> 5.1: The term \"natural fibres\" is used in this Appendix to refer to fibres other than artificial<br /> or synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including<br /> waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres that have been carded, combed<br /> or otherwise processed but not spun.<br /> 5.2: The term \"natural fibres\" includes horsehair of Heading 05.03, silk of Headings 50.02<br /> and 50.03 as well as the wool fibres, fine or coarse animal hair of Headings 51.01 to<br /> 51.05, the cotton fibres of Headings 52.01 to 52.03 and the other vegetable fibres of<br /> Headings 53.01 to 53.05.<br /> 5.3: The terms \"textile pulp\", \"chemical Materials\" and \"paper-making Materials\" are used<br /> in this Appendix to describe the Materials not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can<br /> be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.<br /> 5.4: The term \"man-made staple fibres\" is used in this Appendix to refer to synthetic or<br /> artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of Headings 55.01 to 55.07.<br /> Note 6<br /> 6.1: The rules set out in Column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile Materials, used<br /> in the manufacture of this Product, which, taken together, represent [X] per cent or less<br /> of the total weight of all the basic textile Materials used. (See also Notes 6.3 and 6.4<br /> below).<br /> 6.2: However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 6.1 may only be applied to mixed Products<br /> which have been made from two or more basic textile Materials.<br /> The following are the basic textile Materials:<br /> - silk,<br /> - wool,<br /> - coarse animal hair,<br /> - fine animal hair,<br /> - horsehair,<br /> - cotton,<br /> - paper-making Materials and paper,<br /> - flax,<br /> - true hemp,<br /> - jute and other textile bast fibres,<br /> - sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave,<br /> - coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,<br /> - synthetic man-made filaments, artificial man-made filaments,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyphenylene sulphide,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyvinyl chloride,<br /> - other synthetic man-made staple fibres,<br /> - artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose,<br /> - other artificial man-made staple fibres,<br /> - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether<br /> whether or not gimped,<br /> - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester<br /> whether or not gimped,<br /> - Products of Heading 56.05 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a<br /> core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with<br /> aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a<br /> transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film,<br /> - other Products of Heading 56.05.<br /> Example 4: A yarn of Heading 52.05 made from cotton fibres of Heading 52.03<br /> and synthetic staple fibres of Heading 55.06 is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-<br /> originating synthetic staple fibres that do not satisfy the origin rules (which may<br /> require manufacture from chemical Materials or textile pulp) may be used up<br /> to a weight of [X] per cent of the yarn.<br /> Example 5: A woollen fabric of Heading 51.12 made from woollen yarn of<br /> Heading 51.07 and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of Heading 55.09 is a mixed<br /> fabric. Therefore, synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules (which<br /> may require manufacture from chemical Materials or textile pulp) or woollen<br /> yarn that does not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from<br /> natural fibres, not carded or combed or other otherwise prepared for spinning)<br /> or a combination of the two may be used provided their total weight does not<br /> exceed [X] per cent of the weight of the fabric.<br /> Example 6: Tufted textile fabric of Heading 58.02 made from cotton yarn of<br /> Heading 52.05 and cotton fabric of Heading 52.10 is only a mixed Product if<br /> the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric being made from yarns classified in two<br /> separate headings or if the cotton yarn used are themselves mixtures.<br /> Example 7: Where the tufted fabric concerned has been made from cotton<br /> yarn of Heading 52.05 and synthetic fabric of Heading 54.07, then, obviously,<br /> the yarns used are two separate basic textile Materials and the tufted textile<br /> fabric is accordingly a mixed Product.<br /> 6.3: In case of Products incorporating \"yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible<br /> segments of polyether whether or not gimped\" this tolerance is [X] per cent in respect of<br /> this yarn.<br /> 6.4: In the case of Products incorporating \"strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or<br /> of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not<br /> exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of an adhesive between two layers of plastic<br /> film\", this tolerance is [X] per cent in respect of this strip.<br /> Note 7<br /> 7.1: Textile Materials, with the exception of linings and interlinings, which do not satisfy<br /> the rule set out in Column 3 for the made-up Product concerned may be used provided<br /> that they are classified in a Heading other than that of the Product and that their value<br /> does not exceed [X] per cent of the ex-works price of the Product.<br /> 7.2: Without prejudice to Note 6.3, Materials which are not classified within Chapters 50<br /> to 63 may be used freely in the manufacture of textile Products, whether or not they<br /> contain textiles.<br /> Example 8: Where a rule in the Appendix provides that for particular textile<br /> items yarn must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such<br /> as buttons, because buttons are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63. For<br /> the same reason, it does not prevent the use of slide-fasteners, even though<br /> slide-fasteners normally contain textiles.<br /> 7.3: Where a percentage rule applies, the value of Materials which are not classified within<br /> Chapters 50 to 63 must be taken into account when calculating the value of the non-<br /> originating Materials incorporated.<br /> CHEMICAL PROCESSING RULES TO CONFER ORIGINATING STATUS<br /> Note 8<br /> Notes to Section VI of the Harmonized System<br /> Products of the Chemical or Allied Industries (Chapters 28 to 38)<br /> 8.1: Rules 1 through 7 of this Section confer origin to goods of any Chapter, Heading or<br /> Sub-heading in this Section, except as otherwise specified in those rules.<br /> 8.2: Notwithstanding Note 8.1, goods shall be originating if they meet the applicable<br /> change in tariff classification or the percentage value content of non-originating material<br /> specified in Column 3 of the Appendix.<br /> Rule 1: Chemical Reaction Origin<br /> 8.3: Goods of Chapters 28 through 38, which are subject to a chemical reaction, shall be<br /> treated as originating if the chemical reaction occurred in the territory of one or more of<br /> the State Parties.<br /> 8.4: For purposes of this section, a \"chemical reaction\" is a process (including a<br /> biochemical process) that results in a molecule with a new structure by breaking<br /> intramolecular bonds and by forming new intramolecular bonds, or by altering the spatial<br /> arrangement of atoms in a molecule.<br /> 8.5: The following are not considered to be chemical reactions for the purposes of<br /> determining whether a Product is an originating good:<br /> (a) dissolution in water or in other solvents;<br /> (b) the elimination of solvents including solvent water; or<br /> (c) the addition or elimination of water of crystallization.<br /> Rule 2: Purification Origin<br /> 8.6: Goods of Chapters 28 through 38 that are subject to purification shall be treated as<br /> originating provided that one of the following occurs in the territory of one or more of the<br /> State Parties:<br /> (a) Purification of goods resulting in the elimination of [X] percent of the content of<br /> existing impurities; or<br /> (b) The reduction or elimination of impurities resulting in goods suitable for one or<br /> more of the following applications:<br /> (i) Pharmaceutical, medicinal, cosmetic, veterinary, or food grade substances;<br /> (ii) Chemical Products and reagents for analytical, diagnostic or laboratory", "ShowProductAffected": false, "ProductAffected": null, "RevisionName": null, "Rank": 0, "ShowRooExceptions": false, "RooExceptions": null}], "SpecificNote": [{"RooCode": null, "RooText": null, "ShowProductAffected": false, "ProductAffected": null, "RevisionName": null, "Rank": 0, "ShowRooExceptions": false, "RooExceptions": null}], "Documents": [{"DocDesc": "Certificate of origin", "DocFileName": "itc00883_coo.pdf", "DocType": "1_coo", "WebLink": null}, {"DocDesc": "Product-specific rules of origin", "DocFileName": "itc00883_sroo.pdf", "DocType": "2_sroo", "WebLink": "https://rwandatrade.rw/media/Rules%20of%20Origin%20Appendix.pdf"}, {"DocDesc": "Chapter on rules of origin", "DocFileName": "itc00883_roo.pdf", "DocType": "3_roo", "WebLink": null}, {"DocDesc": "Full text of agreement", "DocFileName": "itc00883_full.pdf", "DocType": "8_full", "WebLink": "https://au.int/en/treaties/agreement-establishing-african-continental-free-trade-area"}]}, "FtaProvisions": {"RooProvision": [{"ProvisionAbbrev": "accum", "ProvisionCode": "Cumulation", "ProvisionValue": "diagonal and full", "ProvisionRank": null, "ProvisionGlossary": "A provision which allows to consider goods obtained in as well as processing taking place in one FTA member country as originating in another.", "ProvisionGlossaryLink": "/en/glossary?uid=accum&returnto=gloscenter", "ProvisionLegalExtract": "Article 10 : Cumulation of Origin within the Continent <br /> 1 For the purposes of implementing this Article, all States Parties shall be <br /> considered as a single territory. <br /> 2 Raw materials or semi-finished goods originating in any of the States Parties and <br /> undergoing working or processing in another States Party shall, be deemed to <br /> have originated in the States Party where the final processing or manufacturing <br /> takes place. <br /> 3 Working or processing carried out in any of the States Parties shall be <br /> considered as having been carried out in the States Parties when the materials <br /> undergo further working or processing in a States Party. <br /> 4 Notwithstanding paragraph 1 and 2, products further manufactured in a States <br /> Party shall be considered as originating in a States Party where the last <br /> manufacturing process takes place provided that the last working or processing <br /> operations exceed those operations under Article 9 of this Annex. <br /> Article 33 : Information and procedure for cumulation purposes <br /> 1.

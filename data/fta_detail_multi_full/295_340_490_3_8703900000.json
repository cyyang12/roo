For purposes of determining whether a good imported into its territory from the <br /> territory of the other Party under preferential tariff treatment according to this agreement <br /> qualifies as originating, a Party may verify the origin of the good through its competent <br /> authority by means of: <br /> (a) written questionnaires or requests for information sent directly to the importer in its <br /> territory or the exporter or producer in the territory of the other Party; <br /> (b) verification visits to the exporter or producer in the territory of the other Party to <br /> review the records and documents referred to in Article 5.05 (a), and to inspect the <br /> materials and facilities used in the production of the good in question; <br /> (c) delegating its Embassy in the territory of the other Party to conduct the verification visit; or <br /> (d) other procedures as the Parties may agree to. <br /> 3. For the purposes of this Article, the questionnaires, requests, official letters, <br /> determinations of origin, notifications or any other written communications sent by the <br /> competent authority to the importer, exporter or the producer for origin verification, shall <br /> be considered valid, provided that they are done by the following means: <br /> (a) certified mails with receipts of acknowledgement or other ways that confirm that the <br /> importer, exporter or producer has received the documents; <br /> (b) official communications through the Embassies of the Parties whenever the <br /> competent authority requires; or <br /> (c) any other way as the Parties may agree. <br /> 4. In a written questionnaire or request for information referred to in paragraph 2 (a) it shall: <br /> (a) indicate the time period, which shall be no more than thirty (30) days from the date of <br /> receipt, that the importer, exporter or producer has to duly complete and return the <br /> questionnaire or provide the information requested; and <br /> (b) include the notification of intention to deny preferential tariff treatment, in case the <br /> importer, exporter or producer does not duly complete and return the questionnaire <br /> or does not provide the information requested within such time period. <br /> 5. The importer, exporter or producer who receives a questionnaire or request for <br /> information according to paragraph 2 (a) shall duly complete and return the <br /> questionnaire or respond to the request for information within the time period established <br /> in paragraph 4 (a) from the date of receipt. During that time period, the importer, <br /> exporter or producer may make a written request to the competent authority of the <br /> importing Party for an extension of no more than thirty (30) days. A Party shall not deny <br /> the preferential tariff treatment based solely on the request of an extension for <br /> completing and returning the questionnaire or responding to the information request. <br /> 6. Each Party shall provide that, even if the answered questionnaire or information <br /> requested referred to in paragraph 5 has been received within the specified time period, <br /> it may still request, through its competent authority, additional information from the <br /> importer, exporter or producer, by means of a subsequent questionnaire or request. In <br /> such cases the importer, exporter or producer shall answer the questionnaire or respond <br /> to the request within thirty (30) days from the date of receipt. <br /> 7. If the importer, exporter or producer does not duly complete a questionnaire, or does <br /> not return the questionnaire or provide the information requested within the time period <br /> established in paragraphs 4 (a), 5 and 6 above, the importing Party may deny <br /> preferential tariff treatment to the goods subject to verification, by issuing a written <br /> determination of origin, including facts and the legal basis for that determination, to the <br /> importer, exporter or producer. <br /> 8. Prior to conducting a verification visit according to paragraph 2 (b), the importing Party <br /> shall, through its competent authority, provide a written notification of its intention to <br /> conduct the visit. The notification shall be sent to the exporter or producer to be visited, <br /> the importer, to the certifying authority and the competent authority of the Party in whose <br /> territory the visit will be conducted, and, if necessary, to the embassy of the other Party <br /> in the territory of the importing Party. The competent authority of the importing Party <br /> shall request the written consent from the exporter or producer to be visited, to make a <br /> verification visit. <br /> 9. The notification referred to in paragraph 8 shall include: <br /> (a) the name of the competent authority that sends the notification; <br /> (b) the name of the exporter or producer to be visited; <br /> (c) the date and place of the proposed verification visit; <br /> (d) the objective and scope of the verification visit, including the specific reference to the <br /> good subject to verification; <br /> (e) the names and positions of the officers conducting the verification visit; and <br /> (f) the legal basis for carrying out the verification visit. <br /> Any modification of the information referred to in this paragraph shall also be notified <br /> according to paragraph 8. <br /> 10. If the exporter or producer has not given his written consent for the making of the <br /> proposed verification visit within the thirty (30) days of the written notification as provided <br /> in paragraphs 8 and 9, the importing Party may deny preferential tariff treatment to the <br /> good by notifying in writing to the importer, exporter or producer the determination of <br /> origin, including facts and the legal basis for such denial. <br /> 11. When the exporter or producer receives a notification according to paragraphs 8 and <br /> 9, within the fifteen (15) days from the date on which the notification was received may, <br /> one time only, request in writing the postposition of the visit with the corresponding <br /> justifications, for a period no longer than thirty (30) days from the date on which the <br /> notification was received, or for a longer term the competent authority of the importing <br /> Party and the exporter or producer may agree. For these purposes, the competent <br /> authority of the importing Party shall notify the postposition of the visit to the importer, <br /> exporter or producer of the good, the competent authority and the certifying authority of <br /> the exporting Party. <br /> 12. A Party shall not deny the preferential tariff treatment based solely on the request to <br /> postpone the verification visit, according to paragraph 11. <br /> 13. Each Party shall permit an exporter or producer who is subject to a verification visit <br /> to designate two observers to be present during the visit, provided that the observers <br /> only participate in that manner. Nevertheless, the failure to designate the observers shall <br /> not be a cause for postponing the visit. <br /> 14. Each Party shall require that an exporter or a producer provides the records and <br /> documents referred to in Article 5.05(a) to the competent authority of the importing Party <br /> conducting a verification visit. If the records and documents are not in possession of the <br /> exporter or producer, the exporter may request to the producer of the good or the <br /> producer may request the supplier of the materials, to deliver these to the competent <br /> authority of the importing Party. <br /> 15. A Party may deny the preferential tariff treatment to an imported good subject to an <br /> origin verification, if the exporter or producer: <br /> (a) fails to provide the records or documents for determining the origin of the good, in <br /> accordance with the provisions of this Chapter and of Chapter 4 (Rules of Origin); or <br /> (b) denies access to the records or documents. <br /> 16. Each Party, through its competent authority, shall verify the compliance of the <br /> requirements of regional value content, De Minimis, or any other provision contained in <br /> Chapter 4 (Rules of Origin) in compliance with the generally accepted accounting <br /> principles that apply in the territory of the Party from which the good was exported. <br /> 17. Once the verification visit has been concluded, the competent authority of the <br /> importing Party shall prepare a minute of the visit, which shall include the facts <br /> confirmed by it. The exporter or producer, subject to the verification visit, may sign this minute. <br /> 18. Within a period of one hundred and twenty (120) days from the conclusion of the <br /> verification of origin, the competent authority of the importing Party shall issue a <br /> determination of origin, in writing, in which it is determined if the good qualifies or not as <br /> originating, which shall include the factual findings and legal basis for the determination <br /> of origin and notify the importer, exporter or producer, as well as the competent authority <br /> and certifying authority of the exporting Party the determination of origin. <br /> 19. When the period established in paragraph 18 concludes and the competent authority <br /> of the importing Party does not issue a determination of origin, the good subject to the <br /> verification of origin shall receive the same preferential tariff treatment as if it were an <br /> originating good. <br /> 20. Where through a verification the importing Party determines that an importer, <br /> exporter or a producer has provided more than once, a false or unfounded certificate of <br /> origin or stating that a good qualifies as originating, the importing Party may suspend <br /> preferential tariff treatment to the identical goods imported, exported or produced by that <br /> person, until it is proved that such person is in compliance with all the requirements <br /> under Chapter 4 (Rules of Origin) and this Chapter. <br /> 21. When the competent authority of the importing Party determines that a good <br /> imported into its territory does not qualify as originating, the importer must pay any <br /> custom duties owed and other applicable charges according to the legislation of each Party. <br /> 22. In case the preferential tariff treatment is resumed, the competent authority of the <br /> importing Party shall issue a written determination of origin in which the competent <br /> authority of the importing Party establishes the resumption of the preferential tariff <br /> treatment for the good, shall be notified to the importer, exporter or producer and the <br /> competent authority and certifying authority of the exporting Party; which shall include <br /> the factual findings and the legal basis of its determination. <br /> 23. A Party shall not apply a determination of origin issued under paragraph 18 to an <br /> importation made before the date of entry into force of the determination origin where: <br /> (a) the customs authority of the exporting Party issued an advance ruling regarding the <br /> tariff classification or valuation of one or more materials used in the good under Article 5.07; <br /> (b) the importing Party's determination is based on a tariff classification or valuation for <br /> such materials that is different than that provided for in the advance ruling referred to <br /> in subparagraph (a); and <br /> (c) the customs authority issued the advance ruling before the importing Party's determination.", "ProvisionValueCssClass": "", "ProvisionDisplayCssClass": null}, {"ProvisionAbbrev": "pen", "ProvisionCode": "Penalties", "ProvisionValue": "provided", "ProvisionRank": null, "ProvisionGlossary": "A provision that specifies the legal consequences of submitting an origin documentation based on incorrect or falsified information.

A specific rule of origin set out in this Annex represents the minimum amount of production required to be carried out on non-originating materials for the resulting good to achieve originating status. A greater amount of production than that required by the rule for that good will also confer originating status.<br /> 3. Where a rule of this Annex applicable to a good contains both a required change in tariff classification and a percentage for the maximum value of non-originating materials, the de minimis provision of Article 307 permits the use of non-originating materials which do not satisfy the tariff change requirement, as long as the value of such materials does not exceed 10 per cent of the transaction value of the good. However, the value of such non-originating materials shall be included when calculating the value of non-originating materials and under no circumstances may the percentage for the maximum value of non-originating materials as set out in the rule be exceeded through the use of the de minimis provision.<br /> 4. Where:<br /> (a) a rule of this Annex applicable to a good contains both a required change in tariff classification and a percentage for the maximum value of non-originating materials, and<br /> (b) one or more of the non-originating materials used in the production of the good are classified in the same subheading, or heading that is not further subdivided into subheadings, as the good itself,<br /> subparagraph (d) of Article 301, which provides that the good shall be considered as originating if the value of the non-originating materials classified as or with the good does not exceed the given percentage of the transaction value of the good, may be applied.<br /> 5. Given that, in the case described in paragraph 4, the good resulting from the application of subparagraph (d) of Article 301 qualifies as originating in its own right, no account shall be taken of the non-originating materials contained therein when that good is used in the production of another good. In this particular instance, only the value of any other non-originating materials that are used in the production of the final good and that satisfy the required change in tariff classification set out in the rule of this Annex would need to be taken into account when calculating the value of non-originating materials for purposes of determining the origin of the final good.<br /> 6.

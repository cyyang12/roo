The first column<br /> gives the heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonized System<br /> and the second column gives the description of goods used in that system for<br /> that heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns, a rule is<br /> specified in columns 3 or 4. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column<br /> is preceded by an 'ex', this signifies that the rules in columns 3 or 4 apply only<br /> to the part of that heading as described in column 2.<br /> 2.2 Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1, or where a<br /> chapter number is given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore<br /> given in general terms, the adjacent rules in columns 3 or 4 apply to all products<br /> which, under the Harmonized System, are classified in headings of the chapter<br /> or in any of the headings grouped together in column 1.<br /> 2.3 Where the list contains different rules applying to different products within a<br /> heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered<br /> by the adjacent rules in columns 3 or 4.<br /> 2.4 Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns<br /> 3 and 4, the exporter may opt, as an alternative, to apply either the rule set out in<br /> column 3 or that set out in column 4. If no origin rule is given in column 4, the<br /> rule set out in column 3 has to be applied.<br /> Note 3:<br /> 3.1 The provisions of Article 7 of the Protocol on Rules of Origin concerning<br /> products having acquired originating status which are used in the manufacture of<br /> other products apply regardless of whether such status has been acquired inside<br /> the factory where these products are used or in another factory in a Party.<br /> Example:<br /> An engine of heading 84.07, for which the rule states that the value of the non-<br /> originating materials which may be incorporated may not exceed 40 per cent of<br /> the ex-works price, is made from \"other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging\"<br /> of heading ex 72.24.<br /> If this forging has been forged in the Party concerned from a non-originating<br /> ingot, it has already acquired originating status by virtue of the rule for heading<br /> ex 72.24 in the list. The forging can then count as originating in the value<br /> calculation for the engine regardless of whether it was produced in the same<br /> factory or in another factory in the Party concerned. The value of the non-<br /> originating ingot is thus not taken into account when adding up the value of the<br /> non-originating materials used.<br /> 3.2 The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing<br /> required and the carrying out of more working or processing also confers<br /> originating status; conversely, the carrying out of less working or processing<br /> cannot confer originating status. Thus, if a rule provides that non-originating<br /> material at a certain level of manufacture may be used, the use of such material<br /> at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed and the use of such material at a<br /> later stage is not.<br /> 3.3 Without prejudice to Note 3.2, where a rule states that \"materials of any<br /> heading\" may be used, materials of the same heading as the product may also be<br /> used, subject, however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained<br /> in the rule. However, the expression \"manufacture from materials of any<br /> heading, including other materials of heading ...\" means that only materials<br /> classified in the same heading as the product of a different description than that<br /> of the product as given in column 2 of the list may be used.<br /> 3.4 When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more<br /> than one material, this means that any one or more materials may be used. It<br /> does not require that all be used.<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for fabrics of headings 52.08 to 52.12 provides that natural fibres may<br /> be used and that chemical materials, among other materials, may also be used.<br /> This does not mean that both have to be used; it is possible to use one or the<br /> other or both.<br /> 3.5 Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a<br /> particular material, the condition obviously does not prevent the use of other<br /> materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule. (See<br /> also Note 6.2 in relation to textiles).<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for prepared foods of heading 19.04 which specifically excludes the use<br /> of cereals and their derivatives does not prevent the use of mineral salts,<br /> chemicals and other additives which are not products from cereals.<br /> However, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be<br /> manufactured from the particular material specified in the list, can be produced<br /> from a material of the same nature at an earlier stage of manufacture.<br /> Example:<br /> In the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 made from non-woven<br /> materials, if the use of only non-originating yarn is allowed for this class of<br /> article, it is not possible to start from non-woven cloth - even if non-woven<br /> cloths cannot normally be made from yarn. In such cases, the starting material<br /> would normally be at the stage before yarn - that is the fibre stage.<br /> 3.6 Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of<br /> non-originating materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be<br /> added together. In other words, the maximum value of all the non-originating<br /> materials used may never exceed the highest of the percentages given.<br /> Furthermore, the individual percentages must not be exceeded in relation to the<br /> particular materials they apply to.<br /> Note 4:<br /> 4.1 The term \"natural fibres\" is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial<br /> or synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place,<br /> including waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres that have been<br /> carded, combed or otherwise processed but not spun.<br /> 4.2 The term \"natural fibres\" includes horsehair of heading 05.11, silk of headings<br /> 50.02 and 50.03 as well as the wool fibres, fine or coarse animal hair of headings<br /> 51.01 to 51.05, the cotton fibres of headings 52.01 to 52.03 and the other<br /> vegetable fibres of headings 53.01 to 53.05.<br /> 4.3 The terms \"textile pulp\", \"chemical materials\" and \"paper-making materials\" are<br /> used in the list to describe the materials not classified in Chapters 50 to 63,<br /> which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.<br /> 4.4 The term \"man-made staple fibres\" is used in the list to refer to synthetic or<br /> artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of headings 55.01 to 55.07.<br /> Note 5:<br /> 5.1 Where for a given product in the list reference is made to this Note, the<br /> conditions set out in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials,<br /> used in the manufacture of this product, which, taken together, represent ten per<br /> cent or less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also<br /> Notes 5.3 and 5.4).<br /> 5.2 However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 5.1 may only be applied to mixed<br /> products which have been made from two or more basic textile materials.<br /> The basic textile materials referred to in this Note are the following:<br /> - silk;<br /> - wool;<br /> - coarse animal hair;<br /> - fine animal hair;<br /> - horsehair;<br /> - cotton;<br /> - paper-making materials and paper;<br /> - flax;<br /> - true hemp;<br /> - jute and other textile bast fibres;<br /> - sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave;<br /> - coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres;<br /> - synthetic man-made filaments;<br /> - artificial man-made filaments;<br /> - current conducting filaments;<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene;<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester;<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide;<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile;<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide;<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene;<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyphenylene sulphide;<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyvinyl chloride;<br /> - other synthetic man-made staple fibres;<br /> - artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose;<br /> - other artificial man-made staple fibres;<br /> - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether<br /> whether or not gimped;<br /> - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester<br /> whether or not gimped;<br /> - products of heading 56.05 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip consisting of<br /> a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated<br /> with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding five mm, sandwiched by<br /> means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic<br /> film; and<br /> - other products of heading 56.05.<br /> Example:<br /> A yarn of heading 52.05 made from cotton fibres of heading 52.03 and synthetic<br /> staple fibres of heading 55.06 is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating<br /> synthetic staple fibres that do not satisfy the origin rules (which require<br /> manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) may be used up to a weight<br /> of ten per cent of the yarn.<br /> Example:<br /> A woollen fabric of heading 51.12 made from woollen yarn of heading 51.07<br /> and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading 55.09 is a mixed fabric. Therefore<br /> synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture<br /> from chemical materials or textile pulp) or woollen yarn that does not satisfy the<br /> origin rules (which require manufacture from natural fibres, not carded or<br /> combed or otherwise prepared for spinning) or a combination of the two may be<br /> used provided their total weight does not exceed ten per cent of the weight of the<br /> fabric.<br /> Example:<br /> Tufted textile fabric of heading 58.02 made from cotton yarn of heading 52.05<br /> and cotton fabric of heading 52.10 is only a mixed product if the cotton fabric is<br /> itself a mixed fabric being made from yarns classified in two separate headings<br /> or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.<br /> Example:<br /> If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading<br /> 52.05 and synthetic fabric of heading 54.07, then, obviously, the yarns used are<br /> two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is accordingly a<br /> mixed product.<br /> 5.3 In the case of products incorporating \"yarn made of polyurethane segmented<br /> with flexible segments of polyether whether or not gimped\" the tolerance<br /> referred to in Note 5.1 is 20 per cent in respect of this yarn.<br /> 5.4 In the case of products incorporating \"strip consisting of a core of aluminium<br /> foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of<br /> a width not exceeding five mm, sandwiched by means of an adhesive between<br /> two films of plastic film\", the tolerance referred to in Note 5.1 is 30 per cent in<br /> respect of this strip.<br /> Note 6:<br /> 6.1 In the case of textile products which are marked in the list by a footnote referring<br /> to this Note, textile materials, with the exception of linings and interlinings,<br /> which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the made-up<br /> product concerned may be used, provided that they are classified in a heading<br /> other than that of the product and that their value does not exceed eight per cent<br /> of the ex-works price of the product.<br /> 6.2 Without prejudice to Note 6.3, materials which are not classified within<br /> Chapters 50 to 63 may be used freely in the manufacture of textile products,<br /> whether or not they contain textiles.<br /> Example:<br /> If a rule in the list provides that for a particular textile item, such as trousers,<br /> yarn must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons,<br /> because buttons are not classified under Chapters 50 to 63. For the same reason,<br /> it does not prevent the use of slide-fasteners even though slide-fasteners<br /> normally contain textiles.<br /> 6.3 Where a percentage rule applies, the value of materials which are not classified<br /> under Chapters 50 to 63 must be taken into account when calculating the value<br /> of the non-originating materials incorporated.<br /> Note 7<br /> 7.1 For the purposes of headings ex 27.07, 27.13 to 27.15, ex 29.01, ex 29.02 and<br /> ex 34.03, the \"specific processes\" are the following:<br /> (a) vacuum distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;<br /> (c) cracking;<br /> (d) reforming;<br /> (e)<br /> extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f) the process comprising all the following operations: processing with<br /> concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation<br /> with alkaline agents; decolonisation and purification with naturally<br /> active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;<br /> (g) polymerisation;<br /> (h) alkylation; and<br /> (i) isomerisation.<br /> 7.2 For the purposes of headings 27.10, 27.11 and 27.12, the \"specific processes\"<br /> are the following:<br /> (a) vacuum distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;<br /> (c) cracking;<br /> (d) reforming;<br /> (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f) the process comprising all the following operations: processing with<br /> concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation<br /> with alkaline agents; decolonisation and purification with naturally<br /> active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;<br /> (g) polymerisation;<br /> (h) alkylation;<br /> (ij) isomerisation;<br /> (k) in respect of heavy oils falling within heading ex 27.10 only,<br /> desulphurisation with hydrogen resulting in a reduction of at least 85 per<br /> cent of the sulphur content of the products processed (ASTM D 1266-59<br /> T method);<br /> (l) in respect of products falling within heading 27.10 only, deparaffining by<br /> a process other than filtering;<br /> (m) in respect of heavy oils falling within heading ex 27.10 only, treatment<br /> with hydrogen at a pressure of more than 20 bar and a temperature of<br /> more than 250\u00b0C with the use of a catalyst, other than to effect<br /> desulphurisation, when the hydrogen constitutes an active element in a<br /> chemical reaction.

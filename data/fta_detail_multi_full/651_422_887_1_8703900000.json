The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column provides the heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonised System and the second column provides the description of goods used in that system for that heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in column (3) or column (4). Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an \"ex\", this means that the rules in column (3) or column (4) apply only to the part of that heading as described in column (2).<br /> 2.2. \u00a0Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column (1) or a chapter number is given and the description of products in column (2) is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rules in columns 3 or 4 apply to all products which, under the Harmonised System, are classified in headings of the corresponding chapter or in any of the headings grouped together in column 1.<br /> 2.3. \u00a0Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rules in column (3) or (4).<br /> 2.4. \u00a0Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns (3) and (4), the exporter may opt, as an alternative, to apply either the rule set out in column (3) or that set out in column (4). If no origin rule is given in column (4), the rule set out in column (3) is to<br /> be applied.<br /> Note 3:<br /> 3.1. The provisions of Article No. (V) of the present Protocol, concerning products having acquired originating status which are used in the manufacture of other products, shall apply, regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where these products are used or in another factory in an Arab Member State.<br /> Example:<br /> An engine under heading (8407), for which the rule states that the value of the non-originating materials which may be incorporated may not exceed forty per cent (40%) of the ex-works price, is made from \"other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging\" of heading ex (7224).<br /> In the event that this forging operation has been undertaken in an Arab Member State from a non-originating ingot, it has already acquired originating status by virtue of the rule for heading ex (7224) in the list. The forging can then count as originating in the value-calculation for the engine, irrespective of whether it was produced in the same factory or in another factory in the concerned Arab Member State. The value of the non-originating ingot is thus not accounted for when adding up the value of the non-originating materials used.<br /> 3.2. \u00a0The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing required, and the carrying-out of more working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the carrying-out of less working or processing cannot confer originating status. Thus, if a rule provides that non-originating material, at a certain level of manufacture, may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed, and the use of such material at a later stage is not.<br /> 3.3. \u00a0Without prejudice to Note (3.2), where a rule uses the expression \"manufacture from materials of any heading\", materials of the same heading as the product may also be used, subject, however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in the rule. In any case, the expression \"manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of heading ...\" means that only materials included in the same heading as the product and which have different description from that of the product, as contained in column 2 of the list, shall be used.<br /> 3.4. \u00a0When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one material, this means that one or more materials may be used, but does not require that all be used.<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for fabrics of headings (5208) to (5212) provides that natural fibres may be used and that chemical materials, among other materials, may also be used. This does not mean that both have to be used; it is possible to use one or the other, or both.<br /> 3.5. \u00a0Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular material, the condition obviously does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule. (See also Note (6.2) below in relation<br /> to textiles).<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for prepared foods of heading (1904), which specifically excludes the use of cereals and their derivatives, does not prevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and other additives which are not products from cereals.<br /> However, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be manufactured from the particular materials specified in the list, can be produced from a material of the same nature at an earlier stage of manufacture.<br /> Example:<br /> In the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter (62) made from non-woven materials, if the use of only non-originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is not possible to start from non-woven cloth \u2013 even if non-woven cloths cannot normally be made from yarn. In such cases, the starting material would normally be at the stage before yarn \u2013 that is, the fibre stage.<br /> 3.6. Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of non-originating materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be added together. In other words, the maximum value of all the non-originating materials used may never exceed the higher of the percentages given. Furthermore, the individual percentages must not be exceeded, in relation to the particular materials to which they apply.<br /> Note 4:<br /> 4.1. The term \"natural fibres\" is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres which have been carded, combed or otherwise processed, but not spun.<br /> 4.2. \u00a0The term \"natural fibres\" includes horsehair of heading (0503), silk of headings (5002) and (5003), as well as wool-fibres and fine or coarse animal hair of headings (5101) to (5105), cotton fibres of headings (5201) to (5203), and other vegetable fibres of headings (5301) to (5305).<br /> 4.3. \u00a0The terms \"textile pulp\", \"chemical materials\" and \"paper-making materials\" are used in the list to describe the materials, not classified in Chapters (50) to (63), which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.<br /> 4.4. \u00a0The term \"man-made staple fibres\" is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of headings (5501) to (5507).<br /> Note 5:<br /> 5.1. Where, for a given product in the list, reference is made to this Note, the conditions set out in column (3) shall not be applied to any basic textile materials used in the manufacture of this product and which, taken together, account for 10 per cent or less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 5.3 and 5.4 below.)<br /> 5.2. In any case, the tolerance mentioned in Note (5.1) may be applied only to mixed products which have been made from two or more basic textile materials.<br /> The following are the basic textile materials:<br /> a.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 silk,<br /> b.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 wool,<br /> c.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 coarse animal hair,<br /> d.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 fine animal hair,<br /> e.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 horsehair,<br /> f.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 cotton,<br /> g.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 paper-making materials and paper,<br /> h.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 flax,<br /> i.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 true hemp,<br /> j.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 jute and other textile bast fibres,<br /> k.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 sisal and other textile fibres of the Genus Agave,<br /> l.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,<br /> m.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 synthetic filaments,<br /> n.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 artificial filaments,<br /> o.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 polypropylene,<br /> p.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 synthetic fibres of polyester,<br /> q.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 synthetic fibres of polyamide,<br /> r.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 synthetic fibres of polyacrylonitrile,<br /> s.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 synthetic fibres of poly phenylene sulphide,<br /> t.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 other synthetic operations,<br /> u.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 yarn made of polyurethane,<br /> v.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 products of heading (5605) (metallised yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film,<br /> w.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 other products of heading (5605)<br /> Example:<br /> A yarn, of heading (5202), made from cotton fibres of heading (5203) and synthetic staple fibres of heading (5506), is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres which do not satisfy the origin-rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) may be used, up to 10 per cent of the weight of the yarn.<br /> Example:<br /> A woollen fabric, of heading (5112), made from woollen yarn of heading (5107) and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading (5509), is a mixed fabric. Therefore, synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the origin-rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp), or woollen yarn which does not satisfy the origin-rules (which require manufacture from natural fibres, not carded or combed or otherwise prepared for spinning), or a combination of the two, may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10 per cent of the weight of the fabric.<br /> Example:<br /> Tufted textile fabric of heading (5802) made from cotton yarn of heading (5205) and cotton fabric of heading (5210), is only a mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric made from yarns classified in two separate headings, or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.<br /> Example:<br /> If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading (5205) and synthetic fabric of heading (5407), then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is, accordingly, a mixed product.<br /> Example:<br /> Tufted carpet made of artificial yarn and cotton yarn, while the back is made of jute shall be considered to be a mixed product because three basic textile materials have been used. Therefore, it is possible to use non-originating materials incorporated at a later stage of manufacture if such is permitted by the Rule, provided that the total weight thereof shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the textile materials of the carpet. Thus, it shall be permitted to import all the back materials made of jute and/ or artificial yarn at this stage of manufacture, provided that the weight is observed.<br /> 5.3. In the case of products incorporating \"yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped\", this tolerance shall be 20 per cent in respect of this yarn.<br /> 5.4. \u00a0In the case of products incorporating \"strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film\", this tolerance is 30 per cent in respect of this strip.<br /> Note 6:<br /> 6.1. \u00a0Where, in the list, reference is made to this Note, textile materials which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in column (3) for the made-up product concerned, may be used, provided that they are classified in a heading other than that of the product and that their value does not exceed 8 percent of the ex-works price of the product.<br /> 6.2. \u00a0Without prejudice to Note (6.3), materials which are not classified within Chapters (50) to (63) may be used freely in the manufacture of textile products, whether or not they contain textiles.<br /> Example:<br /> If a rule in the list provides that, for a particular textile item (such as trousers), yarn must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because buttons are not classified within Chapters (50) to (63). For the same reason, it does not prevent the use of slide- fasteners, even though slide-fasteners normally contain textiles.<br /> 6.3. \u00a0Where a percentage-rule applies, the value of materials which are not classified within Chapters (50) to (63) must be taken into account when calculating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.<br /> Note 7:<br /> 7.1. For the purposes of headings ex (2707), (2713) to (2715), ex (2901), ex (2902) and ex (3403), the \"specific manufacturing processes\" are as follows:<br /> (a) \u00a0 vacuum-distillation;<br /> (b) \u00a0 re-distillation or cracking of petroleum or gas;<br /> (c) \u00a0 cracking;<br /> (d) \u00a0 distillation or cracking of petroleum or gas;<br /> (e) \u00a0 extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f) \u00a0 the processes comprising all of the following operations:<br /> \u00a7\u00a0 processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum;<br /> \u00a7\u00a0 neutralisation with alkaline agents; and,<br /> \u00a7\u00a0 decolourisation and purification with naturally-active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;<br /> (g) \u00a0polymerisation;<br /> (h) \u00a0alkylation; and<br /> (i) \u00a0 isomerisation.<br /> 7.2.

The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column<br /> gives the heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonised System<br /> and the second column gives the descriptionofgoodsused in that system for that<br /> heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns a rule is specified in<br /> columns 3or4. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded<br /> byan \u2018ex', this signifies that the rules in columns 3 or 4 apply only to the part of<br /> that heading as described in column 2.<br /> 2. Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter<br /> number is given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given<br /> in general terms, the adjacent rules in columns 3 or 4 apply to all products<br /> which, under the HarmonisedSystem, are classified in headings of the chapter<br /> or in any of the headings grouped together in column 1.<br /> 3. Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within<br /> a heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading<br /> covered by the adjacent rules in columns 3or 4.<br /> 4. Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns 3<br /> and 4, the exporter may opt, as an alternative, to apply either the rule set out in<br /> column 3 or that set out in column 4. If no origin rule is given in column 4, the<br /> rule set out in column 3 has to be applied.<br /> Note 3:<br /> 1. The provisions of Article 7 of the Protocol concerning products having acquired<br /> originating status which are used in the manufacture of other products apply<br /> regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where<br /> these products are used or in another factory inthe United Kingdom or in the<br /> CARIFORUM States.<br /> Example:<br /> An engine of heading No 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-<br /> originating materials which may be incorporated may not exceed 40 % ofthe ex-<br /> works price, is made from \u2018other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging' of heading<br /> No ex 7224.<br /> If this forging has been forged in the United Kingdom from a non-originating<br /> ingot, it has already acquired originating status by virtue of the rule forheading<br /> No ex 7224 in the list. The forging can then count as originating in the value<br /> calculation for the engine regardless of whether it was produced in the same<br /> factory or in another factory in the United Kingdom. The value of the non-<br /> originating ingot isthusnot taken into account when adding up the value of the<br /> non- originating materialsused.<br /> 2. The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing<br /> required and the carrying out of more working or processing also confers<br /> originating status; conversely, the carrying out of less working or processing<br /> cannot confer originating status. Therefore, if a rule provides that non-<br /> originating material at a certain level of manufacture may be used, the use of<br /> such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed and the use of such<br /> material at a later stage is not.<br /> 3. Without prejudice to Note 3.2 where a rule states that \u2018materials of any heading'<br /> 1 All examples are given for the purpose of explanation only. They are not legally binding.<br /> 530<br /> may be used, materials of the same heading as the product may also be used,<br /> subject, however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in the<br /> rule. However, the expression \u2018manufacture from materials of any heading,<br /> including other materials of heading No ...' means that only materials classified in<br /> the same heading as the productof a different descriptionthanthatofthe product<br /> as given in column 2 of the list may be used.<br /> 4. When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more<br /> than one material, this means that any one or more materials may be used. It<br /> does not require that all be used.<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for fabrics of heading Nos 5208 to 5212 provides that natural fibres may<br /> be used and that chemical materials, among other materials, may also be used.<br /> This does not mean that both have to be used; it is possible to use one or the other<br /> or both.<br /> 5. Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a<br /> particular material, the condition obviously does not prevent the use of other<br /> materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule. (See<br /> also Note 6.3 below in relation to textiles).<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for prepared foods of heading No 1904 which specifically excludes the<br /> use of cereals and their derivatives does not prevent the use of mineral salts,<br /> chemicals and other additives which are not products from cereals.<br /> However, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be<br /> manufactured from the particular materials specified in the list, can be<br /> produced from a material ofthe same nature at an earlier stage of<br /> manufacture.<br /> Example:<br /> In the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 made from non-woven<br /> materials, if the use of only non- originating yarn is allowed for this class of<br /> article, it is not possible to start from non-woven cloth \u2014 even if non- woven<br /> cloth cannot normally be made from yarn. In such cases, the starting material<br /> would normally beat the stage before yarn \u2014 that is the fibre stage.<br /> 6. Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of<br /> non-originating materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be<br /> added together. In other words, the maximum value ofall the non-originating<br /> materials used may never exceed the highest of the percentages given.<br /> Furthermore, the individual percentages must not be exceeded in relation to the<br /> particular materials they apply to.<br /> Note 4:<br /> 1. The term natural fibres' is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or<br /> synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including<br /> waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres that have been carded,<br /> combed or otherwise processed but not spun.<br /> 2. The term 'natural fibres' includes horsehair of heading No 0503, silk of heading<br /> Nos 5002 and 5003 as well as the wool fibres, fine or coarse animal hair of<br /> heading Nos 5101 to 5105, the cotton fibres of heading Nos 5201 to 5203 and<br /> the other vegetable fibres ofheading Nos 5301 to 5305.<br /> 3. The terms 'textile pulp', 'chemical materials' and paper-making materials' are used<br /> in the list to describe the materials not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can<br /> be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.<br /> 4. The term man-made staple fibres' is used in the list to refer to synthetic or<br /> artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of heading Nos 5501 to 5507.<br /> Note 5:<br /> 1. Where for a given product in the list a reference is made to this note, the<br /> 531<br /> conditions set out in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials,<br /> used in the manufacture of this product, which, taken together, represent 10%<br /> or less of the total weight ofall the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes<br /> 5.3 and 5.4below).<br /> 2. However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 5.1 may only be applied to mixed<br /> products which have been made from two or more basic textile materials.<br /> The following are the basic textile materials:<br /> I. silk<br /> II. wool<br /> III. coarse animal hair<br /> IV. fine animal hair<br /> V. horsehair<br /> VI. cotton<br /> VII. paper-making materials and paper<br /> VIII. flax<br /> IX. true hemp<br /> X. jute and other textile bast fibres<br /> XI. sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave<br /> XII. coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres<br /> XIII. synthetic man-made filaments<br /> XIV. artificial man-made filaments<br /> XV. current conducting filaments<br /> XVI. synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene<br /> XVII. synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester<br /> XVIII. synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide<br /> XIX. synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile<br /> XX. synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide<br /> XXI. synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene<br /> XXII. synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyphenylene sulphide<br /> XXIII. synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyvinyl chloride<br /> XXIV. other synthetic man-made staple fibres<br /> XXV. artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose<br /> XXVI. other artificial man-made staple fibres<br /> XXVII. yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether whether or<br /> not gimped<br /> 532<br /> XXVIII. yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester whether or<br /> not gimped<br /> XXIX. products of heading No 5605 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip<br /> consisting ofa core ofaluminium foil or ofa core ofplastic film whether<br /> or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm,<br /> sandwiched bymeans of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two<br /> layers ofplastic film<br /> XXX. other products of heading No 5605.<br /> Example:<br /> A yarn of heading No 5205 made from cotton fibres of heading No 5203 and<br /> synthetic staple fibres of heading No 5506 is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-<br /> originating synthetic staple fibres that do not satisfy the origin rules (which<br /> require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) may be used up<br /> toa weightof10% ofthe yarn.<br /> Example:<br /> A woollen fabric of heading No 5112 made from woollen yarn of heading No<br /> 5107and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading No 5509 isa mixed fabric.<br /> Therefore synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules (which require<br /> manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) orwoollen yarnthat does<br /> not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from natural fibres, not<br /> carded or combed or otherwise prepared for spinning) ora combination of the<br /> two may be used provided their total weight does not exceed 10% of theweight<br /> of the fabric.<br /> Example:<br /> Tufted textile fabric of heading No 5802 made from cotton yarn of heading No<br /> 5205 and cotton fabric of heading No 5210 is only a mixed product if the cotton<br /> fabric is itself a mixed fabric being made from yarns classified in two separate<br /> headings or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.<br /> Example:<br /> If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading<br /> No 5205 and synthetic fabric of heading No 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used<br /> are two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is accordingly<br /> a mixed product.<br /> 3. In the case of products incorporating yarn made of polyurethane segmented<br /> with flexible segments of polyether whether or not gimped' this tolerance is 20<br /> % in respect of this yarn.<br /> 4. In the case of products incorporating \u2018strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil<br /> or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a<br /> width notexceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of an adhesive between two<br /> layers of plastic film', this tolerance is 30% in respect of this strip.<br /> Note 6:<br /> 1. In the case of those textile products, which are marked in the list by a footnote<br /> referring to this Introductory Note, textile trimmings and accessories which do<br /> not satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the made up products<br /> concerned may be used provided that their weightdoes not exceed 10 % ofthe<br /> total weight of allthe textile materials incorporated.<br /> Textile trimmings and accessories are those classified in Chapters 50 to 63.<br /> Linings and interlinings are not be regarded as trimmings or accessories.<br /> 2. Any non-textile trimmings and accessories or other materials used which<br /> 533<br /> contain textiles do not have to satisfy the conditions set out in column 3 even<br /> though they fall outside the scope of Note 3.5.<br /> 3. In accordance with Note 3.5, any non-originating non-textile trimmings and<br /> accessories or other product, which do not contain any textiles, may, anyway,<br /> be used freely where they cannot be made from the materials listed in column<br /> 3.<br /> For example, if a rule in the list says that for a particular textile item, such as a<br /> blouse, yarn must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as<br /> buttons, because they cannot be made from textile materials.<br /> 4. Where a percentage rule applies, the value of trimmings and accessories must be<br /> taken into account when calculating the value of the non-originating materials<br /> incorporated.<br /> Note 7:<br /> 1. For the purposes of heading Nos ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and<br /> ex 3403, the \u2018specific processes' are the following:<br /> (a) vacuum distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process (1);<br /> (c) cracking;<br /> (d) reforming;<br /> (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f) the process comprising all the following operations: processing with<br /> concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation<br /> with alkaline agents; decolorisation and purification with naturally active<br /> earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;<br /> (g) polymerisation;<br /> (h) alkylation;<br /> (i) isomerisation.<br /> 2.

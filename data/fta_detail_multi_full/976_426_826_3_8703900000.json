The first<br /> column gives the heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonised System<br /> and the second column gives the description of goods used in that system for that<br /> heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns a rule is specified in<br /> columns 3 or 4. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by<br /> an \u2018ex', this signifies that the rules in columns 3 or 4 apply only to the part of that<br /> heading as described in column 2.<br /> 2 Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a<br /> chapter number is given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore<br /> given in general terms, the adjacent rules in columns 3 or 4 apply to all products<br /> which, under the Harmonised System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in<br /> any of the headings grouped together in column 1.<br /> 3 Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within<br /> a heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by<br /> the adjacent rules in columns 3 or 4.<br /> 4 Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both<br /> columns 3 and 4, the exporter may opt, as an alternative, to apply either the rule set<br /> out in column 3 or that set out in column 4. If no origin rule is given in column 4, the<br /> rule set out in column 3 has to be applied.<br /> Note 3:<br /> 1 The provisions of Article 8 of this Protocol concerning products having<br /> acquired originating status which are used in the manufacture of other products apply<br /> regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where these<br /> products are used or in another factory in the UK, the SACU Member States or<br /> Mozambique, respectively.<br /> Example:<br /> An engine of heading No 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-<br /> originating materials which may be incorporated may not exceed 40 per cent of the<br /> ex-works price, is made from \u2018other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging' of<br /> heading No ex 7224.<br /> If this forging has been forged in the UK from a non-originating ingot, it has already<br /> acquired originating status by virtue of the rule for heading No ex 7224 in the list.<br /> The forging can then count as originating in the value calculation for the engine<br /> regardless of whether it was produced in the same factory or in another factory in the<br /> UK. The value of the non-originating ingot is thus not taken into account when<br /> adding up the value of the non- originating materials used.<br /> 2 The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing<br /> required and the carrying out of more working or processing also confers originating<br /> status; conversely, the carrying out of less working or processing cannot confer<br /> originating status. Therefore, if a rule provides that non-originating material at a<br /> certain level of manufacture may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage<br /> of manufacture is allowed and the use of such material at a later stage is not.<br /> 3 Without prejudice to Note 3.2 where a rule states that \u2018materials of any<br /> heading' may be used, materials of the same heading as the product may also be<br /> used, subject, however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in<br /> the rule. However, the expression \u2018manufacture from materials of any heading,<br /> including other materials of heading No \u2026' means that only materials classified in<br /> the same heading as the product of a different description than that of the product as<br /> given in column 2 of the list may be used.<br /> 4 When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from<br /> more than one material, this means that any one or more materials may be used. It<br /> does not require that all be used.<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for fabrics of heading Nos 5208 to 5212 provides that natural fibres may be<br /> used and that chemical materials, among other materials, may also be used. This does<br /> not mean that both have to be used; it is possible to use one or the other or both.<br /> 5 Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a<br /> particular material, the condition obviously does not prevent the use of other<br /> materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule. (See also<br /> Note 6.3 below in relation to textiles).<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for prepared foods of heading No 1904 which specifically excludes the use<br /> of non-originating cereals and their derivatives does not prevent the use of mineral<br /> salts, chemicals and other additives which are not products from cereals.<br /> However, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be<br /> manufactured from the particular materials specified in the list, can be produced from<br /> a material of the same nature at an earlier stage of manufacture.<br /> Example:<br /> In the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 made from non-woven materials,<br /> if the use of only non- originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is not<br /> possible to start from non-woven cloth \u2014 even if non- woven cloths cannot<br /> normally be made from yarn. In such cases, the starting material would normally be<br /> at the stage before yarn \u2014 that is the fibre stage.<br /> of non-originating materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be<br /> added together. In other words, the maximum value of all the non- originating<br /> materials used may never exceed the highest of the percentages given. Furthermore,<br /> the individual percentages must not be exceeded in relation to the particular materials<br /> they apply to.<br /> Note 4:<br /> or synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including<br /> waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres that have been carded, combed<br /> or otherwise processed but not spun.<br /> heading Nos 5002 and 5003 as well as the wool fibres, fine or coarse animal hair of<br /> heading Nos 5101 to 5105, the cotton fibres of heading Nos 5201 to 5203 and the<br /> other vegetable fibres of heading Nos 5301 to 5305.<br /> are used in the list to describe the materials not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which<br /> can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.<br /> artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of heading Nos 5501 to 5507.<br /> Note 5:<br /> 1 Where for a given product in the list a reference is made to this note, the<br /> conditions set out in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials, used<br /> in the manufacture of this product, which, taken together, represent 10 per cent or<br /> less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 5.3 and<br /> 5.4 below).<br /> 2 However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 5.1 may only be applied to mixed<br /> products which have been made from two or more basic textile materials.<br /> The following are the basic textile materials:<br /> \u2014 silk,<br /> \u2014 wool,<br /> \u2014 coarse animal hair,<br /> \u2014 fine animal hair,<br /> \u2014 horsehair,<br /> \u2014 cotton,<br /> \u2014 paper-making materials and paper,<br /> \u2014 flax,<br /> \u2014 true hemp,<br /> \u2014 jute and other textile bast fibres,<br /> \u2014 sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave,<br /> \u2014 coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made filaments,<br /> \u2014 artificial man-made filaments,<br /> \u2014 current conducting filaments,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyphenylene sulphide,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyvinyl chloride,<br /> \u2014 other synthetic man-made staple fibres,<br /> \u2014 artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose,<br /> \u2014 other artificial man-made staple fibres,<br /> \u2014 yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether<br /> whether or not gimped,<br /> \u2014 yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester<br /> whether or not gimped,<br /> \u2014 products of heading No 5605 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip<br /> consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or<br /> not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm,<br /> sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two<br /> layers of plastic film,<br /> \u2014 other products of heading No 5605.<br /> Example:<br /> A yarn of heading No 5205 made from cotton fibres of heading No 5203 and<br /> synthetic staple fibres of heading No 5506 is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-<br /> originating synthetic staple fibres that do not satisfy the origin rules (which require<br /> manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) may be used up to a weight of<br /> 10 per cent of the yarn.<br /> Example:<br /> A woollen fabric of heading No 5112 made from woollen yarn of heading No 5107<br /> and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading No 5509 is a mixed fabric. Therefore<br /> synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture<br /> from chemical materials or textile pulp) or woollen yarn that does not satisfy the<br /> origin rules (which require manufacture from natural fibres, not carded or combed<br /> or otherwise prepared for spinning) or a combination of the two may be used<br /> provided their total weight does not exceed 10 per cent of the weight of the fabric.<br /> Example:<br /> Tufted textile fabric of heading No 5802 made from cotton yarn of heading No 5205<br /> and cotton fabric of heading No 5210 is only a mixed product if the cotton fabric is<br /> itself a mixed fabric being made from yarns classified in two separate headings or if<br /> the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.<br /> Example:<br /> If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading No<br /> 5205 and synthetic fabric of heading No 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are<br /> two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is accordingly a<br /> mixed product.<br /> 3 In the case of products incorporating \u2018yarn made of polyurethane segmented<br /> with flexible segments of polyether whether or not gimped' this tolerance is 20 per<br /> cent in respect of this yarn.<br /> 4 In the case of products incorporating \u2018strip consisting of a core of aluminium<br /> foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a<br /> width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of an adhesive between two layers<br /> of plastic film', this tolerance is 30 per cent in respect of this strip.<br /> Note 6:<br /> 1 In the case of those textile products, which are marked in the list by a footnote<br /> referring to this Introductory Note, textile trimmings and accessories which do not<br /> satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the made up products concerned<br /> may be used provided that their weight does not exceed 10 % of the total weight of<br /> all the textile materials incorporated.<br /> Textile trimmings and accessories are those classified in Chapters 50 to 63. Linings<br /> and interlinings are not to be regarded as trimmings or accessories.<br /> 2 Any non-textile trimmings and accessories or other materials used which<br /> contain textiles do not have to satisfy the conditions set out in column 3 even though<br /> they fall outside the scope of Note 3.5.<br /> 3 In accordance with Note 3.5, any non-originating non-textile trimmings and<br /> accessories or other product, which do not contain any textiles, may, anyway, be<br /> used freely where they cannot be made from the materials listed in column 3.<br /> For example1, if a rule in the list says that for a particular textile item, such as a<br /> blouse, yarn must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as<br /> buttons, because they cannot be made from textile materials.<br /> 4 Where a percentage rule applies, the value of trimmings and accessories must<br /> be taken into account when calculating the value of the non-originating materials<br /> incorporated.<br /> Note 7:<br /> 1 For the purposes of heading Nos ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902<br /> and ex 3403, the \u2018specific processes' are the following:<br /> (a) vacuum distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;<br /> (c) cracking;<br /> (d) reforming;<br /> (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f) the process comprising all the following operations: processing with<br /> concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride;<br /> neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification<br /> with naturally active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or<br /> bauxite;<br /> (g) polymerisation;<br /> (h) alkylation;<br /> (i) isomerisation.<br /> 2 For the purposes of heading Nos 2710, 2711 and 2712, the \u2018specific<br /> processes' are the following:<br /> (a) vacuum distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;<br /> (c) cracking;<br /> (d) reforming;<br /> 1 This example is given for the purpose of explanation only.

In light of this, unless and until that agreement is applicable, cumulation (provided for in <br /> paragraphs 2 to 6 of this Article) with respect to the European Union may nonetheless continue to be <br /> simultaneously applied for an interim period of three years, provided that the United Kingdom and <br /> the European Union have arrangements on administrative cooperation which ensure correct <br /> implementation of this Article and that a preferential trade agreement in accordance with Article <br /> XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 is applicable between SACU, <br /> Mozambique and the European Union. No later than six months before the end of the interim period, <br /> the Parties shall consult as to whether the period should be extended. This provision may be modified, <br /> and the interim period extended, by decision of the Trade and Development Committee. Should such <br /> modification be required, the Parties shall aim to put in place arrangements that are no less beneficial <br /> in respect of trade between them. <br /> Article 5 : Cumulation with respect to Materials which are subject to MFN Duty Free Treatment in the UK <br /> 1 Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 2(2) of this Protocol, non- <br /> originating materials which at importation into the UK are free of customs duties by <br /> means of application of conventional rates of the most-favoured nation tariff in <br /> accordance with the UK's tariff schedule shall be considered as materials originating <br /> in a SACU Member State or Mozambique when incorporated into a product obtained <br /> there. It shall not be necessary that such materials have undergone sufficient working <br /> or processing, provided they have undergone working or processing going beyond <br /> that referred to in Article 9(1) of this Protocol. <br /> 2 Movement certificates EUR.1 (in Box 7) or origin declarations issued by <br /> application of paragraph 1 shall bear the following entry: <br /> \u2018Application of Article 5(1) of Protocol 1 of the SACUM-UK EPA' <br /> 3 The UK shall notify yearly to the Special Committee on Customs and Trade <br /> Facilitation referred to in Article 50 of this Agreement (\u2018The Committee') the list of <br /> materials to which the provisions of this Article shall apply. <br /> 4 The cumulation provided for in this Article shall not apply to materials: <br /> (a) which at importation into the UK are subject to anti-dumping or <br /> countervailing duties when originating from the country which is <br /> subject to these anti-dumping or countervailing duties [15]; <br /> (b) classified in subheadings of the Harmonised System which include, <br /> in the UK's tariff schedule, 8-digit tariff lines which are not free of <br /> customs duties by means of application of conventional rates of the <br /> UK's most-favoured nation tariff. <br /> [15] For the purpose of the implementation of this specific exclusion, UK non-preferential rules of origin <br /> Article 6 : Cumulation with respect to Materials originating in other Countries benefiting from Preferential Duty-Free Quota-Free Access to the UK <br /> 1 Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 2(2) of this Protocol, materials <br /> shall be considered as materials originating in a SACU Member State or <br /> Mozambique when incorporated into a product obtained there, provided: <br /> (a) they have undergone working or processing going beyond that <br /> referred to in Article 9(1) of this Protocol; and <br /> (b) they meet the requirements of paragraph 1A. <br /> 1A.

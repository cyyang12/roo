The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column gives<br /> the heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonized System and the second<br /> column gives the description of goods used in that system for that heading or chapter.<br /> For each entry in the first two columns a rule is specified in columns 3 or 4. Where, in<br /> some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an \"ex\", this signifies that the<br /> rules in columns 3 or 4 apply only to the part of that heading as described in column 2.<br /> 2.  Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number is<br /> given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the<br /> adjacent rules in columns 3 or 4 apply to all products which, under the Harmonized<br /> System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in any of the headings grouped<br /> together in column 1.<br /> 3.  Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading,<br /> each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent<br /> rules in columns 3 or 4.<br /> 4.  Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns 3 and 4,<br /> the exporter may opt, as an alternative, to apply either the rule set out in column 3 or that<br /> set out in column 4. If no origin rule is given in column 4, the rule set out in column 3<br /> has to be applied.<br /> Note 3:<br /> 1.  The provisions of Article 7 of the Protocol concerning products having acquired<br /> originating status which are used in the manufacture of other products apply regardless<br /> of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where these products are used<br /> or in another factory in Turkey or in Mauritius.<br /> Example:<br /> An engine of heading No 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the<br /> non-originating materials which may be incorporated may not exceed 40 per cent of the<br /> ex-works price, is made from \"other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging\" of heading<br /> No ex 7224.<br /> If this forging has been forged in Turkey from a non-originating ingot, it has already<br /> acquired originating status by virtue of the rule for heading No ex 7224 in the list. The<br /> forging can then count as originating in the value calculation for the engine regardless of<br /> whether it was produced in the same factory or in another factory in Turkey. The value<br /> of the non-originating ingot is thus not taken into account when adding up the value of<br /> the non-originating materials used.<br /> 2 The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing required<br /> and the carrying out of more working or processing also confers originating status;<br /> conversely, the carrying out of less working or processing cannot confer originating<br /> status. Therefore, if a rule provides that non-originating material at a certain level of<br /> manufacture may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is<br /> allowed and the use of such material at a later stage is not.<br /> 3 Without prejudice to Note 3.2 where a rule states that \"materials of any heading\" may be<br /> used, materials of the same heading as the product may also be used, subject, however,<br /> to any specific limitations which may also be contained in the rule. However, the<br /> expression \"manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of<br /> heading No ...\" means that only materials classified in the same heading as the product<br /> of a different description than that of the product as given in column 2 of the list may be<br /> used.<br /> 4 When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one<br /> material, this means that any one or more materials may be used. It does not require that<br /> all be used.<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for fabrics of heading Nos 5208 to 5212 provides that natural fibres may be<br /> used and that chemical materials, among other materials, may also be used. This does<br /> not mean that both have to be used; it is possible to use one or the other or both.<br /> 5 Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular<br /> material, the condition obviously does not prevent the use of other materials which,<br /> because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule. (See also Note 6.3 below in<br /> relation to textiles).<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for prepared foods of heading No 1904 which specifically excludes the use of<br /> cereals and their derivatives does not prevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and<br /> other additives which are not products from cereals.<br /> However, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be manufactured<br /> from the particular materials specified in the list, can be produced from a material of the<br /> same nature at an earlier stage of manufacture.<br /> Example:<br /> In the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 made from non-woven materials, if<br /> the use of only non-originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is not possible<br /> to start from non-woven cloth - even if non-woven cloths cannot normally be made from<br /> yarn. In such cases, the starting material would normally be at the stage before yarn -<br /> that is the fibre stage.<br /> 6.  Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of<br /> non-originating materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be added<br /> together. In other words, the maximum value of all the non-originating materials used<br /> may never exceed the highest of the percentages given. Furthermore, the individual<br /> percentages must not be exceeded in relation to the particular materials they apply to.<br /> Note 4:<br /> 1.  The term \"natural fibres\" is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or<br /> synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste,<br /> and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres that have been carded, combed or<br /> otherwise processed but not spun.<br /> 2.  The term \"natural fibres\" includes horsehair of heading No<br /> Nos 5002 and 5003 as well as the wool fibres, fine or coarse animal hair of heading<br /> Nos 5101 to 5105, the cotton fibres of heading Nos 5201 to 5203 and the other vegetable<br /> fibres of heading Nos 5301 to 5305.<br /> 3.  The terms \"textile pulp\", \"chemical materials\" and \"paper-making materials\" are used in<br /> the list to describe the materials not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to<br /> manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.<br /> 4.  The term \"man-made staple fibres\" is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial<br /> filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of heading Nos 5501 to 5507.<br /> Note 5:<br /> 1.  Where for a given product in the list a reference is made to this note, the conditions set<br /> out in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials, used in the<br /> manufacture of this product, which, taken together, represent 10 per cent or less of the<br /> total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 5.3 and 5.4 below).<br /> 2.  However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 5.1 may only be applied to mixed products<br /> which have been made from two or more basic textile materials.<br /> The following are the basic textile materials:<br /> - silk,<br /> - wool,<br /> - coarse animal hair,<br /> - fine animal hair,<br /> - horsehair,<br /> - cotton,<br /> - paper-making materials and paper,<br /> - flax,<br /> - true hemp,<br /> - jute and other textile bast fibres,<br /> - sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave,<br /> - coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,<br /> - synthetic man-made filaments,<br /> - artificial man-made filaments,<br /> - current conducting filaments<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyphenylene sulphide,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyvinyl chloride,<br /> - other synthetic man-made staple fibres,<br /> - artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose,<br /> - other artificial man-made staple fibres,<br /> - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether whether or<br /> not gimped,<br /> - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester whether or<br /> not gimped,<br /> - products of heading No 5605 (metallized yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core<br /> of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium<br /> powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or<br /> coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film,<br /> - other products of heading No 5605.<br /> Example:<br /> A yarn of heading No 5205 made from cotton fibres of heading No 5203 and synthetic<br /> staple fibres of heading No 5506 is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic<br /> staple fibres that do not satisfy the origin rules<br /> chemical materials or textile pulp) may be used up to a weight of 10 per cent of the yarn.<br /> Example:<br /> A woollen fabric of heading No 5112 made from woollen yarn of heading No 5107 and<br /> synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading No 5509 is a mixed fabric. Therefore synthetic<br /> yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from chemical<br /> materials or textile pulp) or woollen yarn that does not satisfy the origin rules (which<br /> require manufacture from natural fibres, not carded or combed or otherwise prepared for<br /> spinning) or a combination of the two may be used provided their total weight does not<br /> exceed 10 per cent of the weight of the fabric.<br /> Example:<br /> Tufted textile fabric of heading No 5802 made from cotton yarn of heading No 5205 and<br /> cotton fabric of heading No 5210 is only a mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a<br /> mixed fabric being made from yarns classified in two separate headings or if the cotton<br /> yarns used are themselves mixtures.<br /> Example:<br /> If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading<br /> No 5205 and synthetic fabric of heading No 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are<br /> two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is accordingly a mixed<br /> product.<br /> 3 In the case of products incorporating \"yarn made of polyurethane segmented with<br /> flexible segments of polyether whether or not gimped\" this tolerance is 20 per cent in<br /> respect of this yarn.<br /> 4 In the case of products incorporating \"strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a<br /> core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not<br /> exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of an adhesive between two layers of plastic<br /> film\", this tolerance is 30 per cent in respect of this strip.<br /> Note 6:<br /> 1.  In the case of those textile products, which are marked in the list by a footnote referring<br /> to this Introductory Note, textile trimmings and accessories which do not satisfy the rule<br /> set out in the list in column 3 for the made up products concerned may be used provided<br /> that their weight does not exceed 10% of the total weight of all the textile materials<br /> incorporated.<br /> Textile trimmings and accessories are those classified in Chapters 50 to 63. Linings and<br /> interlinings are not be regarded as trimmings or accessories.<br /> 2.  Any non-textile trimmings and accessories or other materials used which contain textiles<br /> do not have to satisfy the conditions set out in column 3 even though they fall outside<br /> the scope of Note 3.5.<br /> 3.  In accordance with Note 3.5, any non-originating non-textile trimmings and accessories<br /> or other product, which do not contain any textiles, may, anyway, be used freely where<br /> they cannot be made from the materials listed in column 3.<br /> For example,1if a rule in the list says that for a particular textile item, such as a blouse,<br /> yarn must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because<br /> they cannot be made from textile materials.<br /> 4.  Where a percentage rule applies, the value of trimmings and accessories must be taken<br /> into account when calculating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.<br /> Note 7:<br /> 1 For the purposes of heading Nos ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex 3403,<br /> the \"specific processes\" are the following:<br /> (a) vacuum distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process2;<br /> (c) cracking;<br /> (d) reforming;<br /> (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f) the process comprising all the following operations: processing with concentrated<br /> sulphuric  acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralization  with alkaline  agents;<br /> decolorization and purification with naturally active earth, activated earth, activated<br /> charcoal or bauxite;<br /> (g) polymerization;<br /> (h) alkylation;<br /> (i) isomerization.<br /> 2 For the purposes of heading Nos 2710, 2711 and 2712, the \"specific processes\" are the<br /> following:<br /> (a) vacuum distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process (1)<br /> 1 This example is given for the purpose of explanation only.

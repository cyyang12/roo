There are four different types of rules,<br /> which vary according to the product:<br /> (a) through working or processing a maximum content of non-originating<br /> materials is not exceeded;<br /> (b) through working or processing the four-digit HS heading or six-digit HS<br /> subheading of the manufactured products becomes different from the<br /> four-digit HS heading or six-digit HS subheading, respectively, of the<br /> materials used. However, in the case set out in the second paragraph of<br /> Note 3.3., the four-digit HS heading or six-digit HS subheading of the<br /> manufactured products may be the same as the four-digit HS heading or<br /> six-digit HS subheading, respectively, of the materials used;<br /> (c) a specific working and processing operation is carried out; or<br /> (d) working or processing is carried out on certain wholly obtained<br /> materials.<br /> Note 2 - The Structure of the List of Required Working or Processing<br /> 2.1. The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column<br /> gives the heading number or Chapter number used in the HS and the second column<br /> gives the description of goods used in that system for that heading or Chapter. For<br /> each entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in column 3. Where, in some<br /> cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an \"ex\", this signifies that the rules<br /> in column 3 apply only to the part of that heading as described in column 2.<br /> 2.2. Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a Chapter<br /> number is given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in<br /> general terms, the adjacent rules in column 3 apply to all products which, under the<br /> HS, are classified in headings of the Chapter or in any of the headings grouped<br /> together in column 1.<br /> 2.3. Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within<br /> a heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by<br /> the adjacent rules in column 3.<br /> 2.4. Where two alternative rules are set out in column 3 that are separated by use<br /> of a different line and linked by an \"or\", it shall be at the choice of the exporter which<br /> one to use.<br /> Note 3 - Examples of How to Apply the Rules<br /> 3.1. Article 5 (Sufficiently Worked or Processed Products), concerning products<br /> having acquired originating status which are used in the manufacture of other<br /> products, applies regardless of whether that status has been acquired inside the<br /> factory where those products are used or in another factory in a Party.<br /> 3.2. Pursuant to Article 6 (Insufficient Working or Processing), the working or<br /> processing carried out must go beyond the list of operations mentioned in that Article.<br /> If it does not, the goods shall not qualify for the granting of the preferential tariff<br /> treatment, even if the conditions set out in the list below are met.<br /> Subject to the first paragraph, the rules in the list represent the minimum amount of<br /> working or processing required. The carrying-out of more working or processing also<br /> confers originating status, without prejudice to Article 6 (Insufficient Working or<br /> Processing). Conversely, the carrying-out of less working or processing shall not<br /> confer originating status.<br /> 3.3. Where a rule uses the expression \"Manufacture from materials of any heading,<br /> except that of the product\" all non-originating materials classified in headings other<br /> than that of the product may be used (Change in Tariff Heading).<br /> Where a rule uses the expression \"Manufacture from materials of any heading\", then<br /> materials of any heading(s) (even materials of the same description and heading as<br /> the product) may be used.<br /> 3.4. Where a rule uses the expression \"Manufacture in which the value of all the<br /> materials used does not exceed x % of the ex-works price of the product\" then the<br /> value of all non-originating materials is to be considered and the percentage for the<br /> maximum value of non-originating materials may not be exceeded through the use<br /> of paragraph 3 of Article 5 (Sufficiently Worked or Processed Products).<br /> 3.5. If a rule provides that a specific non-originating material may be used, the use<br /> of materials which are still in an earlier stage of the manufacturing process of that<br /> specific material is allowed, and the use of materials resulting from further<br /> processing of that specific non- originating material is not.<br /> If a rule provides that a specific non-originating material may not be used, the use of<br /> materials which are still in an earlier stage of the manufacturing process of that<br /> specific non-originating material is allowed, and the use of materials resulting from<br /> further processing of that specific non-originating material is not.<br /> Example: when the rule for Chapter 19 requires that \"non-originating materials of<br /> headings 1101 to 1108 cannot exceed 20 % of the weight\", the use of non-originating<br /> cereals of Chapter 10 (materials at an earlier stage in the manufacturing process of<br /> goods of headings 1101 to 1108) is not limited by the requirement concerning the 20<br /> % of the weight.<br /> 3.6. When a rule specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one<br /> material, one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all materials be<br /> used.<br /> 3.7. Where a rule specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular<br /> material, it does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their<br /> inherent nature, cannot satisfy that requirement.<br /> Example: Flat-rolled products of iron and non-alloy steel, of a width of 600 mm or<br /> more, which have been painted, varnished or coated with plastics are classified in the<br /> HS under 7210 70. The rule for 7210 is \"Manufacture from ingots or other primary<br /> forms or semi-finished materials of heading 7206 or 7207\". This rule does not<br /> prevent the use of non-originating paint and varnish (heading 3208) or plastics<br /> (Chapter 39).<br /> Note 4 - General Provisions Concerning Certain Agricultural Goods<br /> 4.1. Agricultural goods falling within Chapters 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 12 and heading<br /> 2401 which are grown or harvested in a Party shall be treated as originating in that<br /> Party, even if grown from seeds, bulbs, rootstock, cuttings, grafts, shoots, buds, or<br /> other live parts of plants imported from a third country.<br /> 4.2. Whenever the rules for products in Chapters 1 to 24 incorporate some<br /> limitations in weight, it should be noted that in accordance with paragraph 2 of<br /> Article 5 (Sufficiently Worked or Processed Products), those limitations in weight<br /> only apply to non-originating materials. Consequently, originating materials are not<br /> to be taken into account for the calculation of the limitations in weight. In addition,<br /> those limitations are expressed in different manners. In particular:<br /> (a) When the rule uses the expression \"the weight of the materials of<br /> Chapters/headings\", the weight of each material mentioned shall be<br /> added up and the total weight shall not exceed the maximum percentage.<br /> Example: The rule for Chapter 19 provides that the weight of the materials of<br /> Chapters 2, 3 and 16 used does not exceed 20 % of the weight of the final product.<br /> In case the weight of the final product contains 12 % of materials of Chapter 3 and<br /> 10 % of materials of Chapter 16, the product does not meet the origin conferring rule<br /> of Chapter 19 as the combined weight exceeds 20 % of the weight of the final<br /> product.<br /> (b) When the rule uses the expression \"the individual weight of the materials<br /> of Chapters/headings\" the weight of each material mentioned shall not<br /> exceed the maximum percentage. The combined weight of the materials<br /> added together has no relevance.<br /> Example: The rule for Chapter 22 provides that the individual weight of sugar and<br /> of the materials of Chapter 4 does not exceed 20 % of the weight of the final product.<br /> In case the weight of the final product contains 15 % of sugar as well as 10 % of<br /> materials of Chapter 4, the origin conferring rule of Chapter 22 is complied with.<br /> Each individual material is less than 20 % of the weight of the final product. On the<br /> contrary, in case the weight of the final product contains 25 % of sugar and 10 % of<br /> materials of Chapter 4, the origin conferring rule is not complied with.<br /> (c) When the rule uses the expression \"the total combined weight of sugar<br /> and the materials of Chapter 4 used does not exceed x % of the weight<br /> of the final product\", both the weight of the sugar and the materials of<br /> Chapter 4 shall meet individually their weight limitation, and their<br /> combined weights added up shall meet the combined weight limitation.<br /> A combined weight limitation expresses a further restriction to the<br /> individual weight limitations.<br /> Example: The rule for heading 1704 provides that the total combined weight of sugar<br /> and the materials of Chapter 4 used does not exceed 50 % of the weight of the final<br /> product. The individual weight limitations for materials of Chapter 4 are 20 % and<br /> for sugar 40 %. In case the weight of the final product contains 35 % of sugar and 15<br /> % of materials of Chapter 4, both the individual weight limitations and the combined<br /> weight limitations of the origin conferring rule of heading 1704 are complied with.<br /> On the contrary, in case the weight of the final product contains 35 % of sugar and<br /> 20 % of materials of Chapter 4, the combined weight represents 55 % of the weight<br /> of the final product. In that case the individual weight limitations are respected but<br /> the combined weight limitation is exceeded and therefore the origin conferring rule<br /> of heading 1704 is not complied with.<br /> Note 5 - Terminology Used in Respect of Certain Textile Products<br /> 5.1. The term \"natural fibres\" is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial<br /> or synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including<br /> waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres which have been carded,<br /> combed or otherwise processed, but not spun.<br /> 5.2. The term \"natural fibres\" includes horsehair of heading 0511, silk of headings<br /> 5002 and 5003, as well as wool-fibres and fine or coarse animal hair of headings<br /> 5101 to 5105, cotton fibres of headings 5201 to 5203, and other vegetable fibres of<br /> headings 5301 to 5305.<br /> 5.3. The terms \"textile pulp\", \"chemical materials\" and \"paper-making materials\"<br /> are used in the list to describe the materials, not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which<br /> can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.<br /> 5.4. The term \"man-made staple fibres\" is used in the list to refer to synthetic or<br /> artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste of headings 5501 to 5507.<br /> Note 6 - Tolerances Applicable to Products Made of a Mixture of Textile Materials<br /> 6.1. Where, for a given product in the list, reference is made to this Note, the<br /> conditions set out in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials used<br /> in the manufacture of this product and which, taken together, represent 10 % or less<br /> of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 6.3 and 6.4).<br /> 6.2. However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 6.1 may be applied only to mixed<br /> products which have been made from two or more basic textile materials.<br /> The following are the basic textile materials:<br /> - silk,<br /> - wool,<br /> - coarse animal hair,<br /> - fine animal hair,<br /> - horsehair,<br /> - cotton,<br /> - paper-making materials and paper,<br /> - flax,<br /> - true hemp,<br /> - jute and other textile bast fibres,<br /> - sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave,<br /> - coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,<br /> - synthetic man-made filaments,<br /> - artificial man-made filaments,<br /> - current-conducting filaments,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(phenylene sulphide),<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(vinyl chloride),<br /> - other synthetic man-made staple fibres,<br /> - artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose,<br /> - other artificial man-made staple fibres,<br /> - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of<br /> polyether, whether or not gimped,<br /> - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of<br /> polyester, whether or not gimped,<br /> - products of heading 5605 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip consisting<br /> of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not<br /> coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm,<br /> sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two<br /> layers of plastic film,<br /> - other products of heading 5605,<br /> - glass fibres,<br /> - metal fibres.<br /> Example: A yarn of heading 5205, made from cotton fibres of heading 5203 and<br /> synthetic staple fibres of heading 5506, is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating<br /> synthetic staple fibres which do not satisfy the origin rules may be used, provided<br /> that their total weight does not exceed 10 % of the weight of the yarn.<br /> Example: A woollen fabric of heading 5112, made from woollen yarn of heading<br /> 5107 and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading 5509, is a mixed fabric. Therefore,<br /> synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules, or woollen yarn which does<br /> not satisfy the origin rules, or a combination of the two, may be used, provided that<br /> their total weight does not exceed 10 % of the weight of the fabric.<br /> Example: Tufted textile fabric of heading 5802, made from cotton yarn of heading<br /> 5205 and cotton fabric of heading 5210, is only a mixed product if the cotton fabric<br /> is itself a mixed fabric made from yarns classified in two separate headings, or if the<br /> cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.<br /> Example: If the tufted textile fabric concerned was made from cotton yarn of heading<br /> 5205 and synthetic fabric of heading 5407, the yarns used are two separate basic<br /> textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is, accordingly, a mixed product.<br /> 6.3. In the case of products incorporating \"yarn made of polyurethane segmented<br /> with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped\", this tolerance is 20 %<br /> in respect of this yarn.<br /> 6.4. In the case of products incorporating \"strip consisting of a core of aluminium<br /> foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a<br /> width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured<br /> adhesive between two layers of plastic film\", this tolerance is 30 % in respect of this<br /> strip.<br /> Note 7 - Other Tolerances Applicable to Certain Textile Products<br /> 7.1. Where, in the list, reference is made to this Note, textile materials which do<br /> not satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the made-up product concerned,<br /> may be used, provided that they are classified in a heading other than that of the<br /> product and that their value does not exceed 8 % of the ex-works price of the product.<br /> 7.2. Without prejudice to Note 7.3, materials which are not classified within<br /> Chapters 50 to 63 may be used freely in the manufacture of textile products, whether<br /> or not they contain textiles.<br /> Example: If a rule provides that, for a particular textile item (such as trousers), yarn<br /> shall be used, it does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because<br /> buttons are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63. For the same reason, it does not<br /> prevent the use of slide- fasteners, even though slide-fasteners normally contain<br /> textiles.<br /> 7.3. Where a percentage rule applies, the value of non-originating materials which<br /> are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63 shall be taken into account when<br /> calculating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.<br /> Note 8 - Definition of Specific Processes and Simple Operations Carried out in<br /> Respect of Certain Products of Chapter 27<br /> 8.1. For the purposes of headings ex 2707 and 2713, the \"specific processes\" are<br /> the following:<br /> (a) vacuum-distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;<br /> (c) cracking;<br /> (d) reforming;<br /> (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f) the process comprising all of the following operations: processing with<br /> concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation<br /> with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification with naturally<br /> active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;<br /> (g) polymerisation;<br /> (h) alkylation; and<br /> (i) isomerisation.<br /> 8.2.

In advance of the conclusion of trade negotiations between the European <br> Union and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the \"United <br> Kingdom\"), the United Kingdom and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam (\"Viet <br> Nam\") recognise that a trilateral approach to rules of origin, involving the European <br> Union, is the preferred outcome in trading arrangements between the United <br> Kingdom and Viet Nam, and the European Union. This approach would replicate <br> coverage of existing trade flows and allow for continued recognition of originating <br> content from either of the United Kingdom and Viet Nam and from the European <br> Union in exports to each other, as per the intention of the Free Trade Agreement <br> between the European Union and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. In this regard, <br> the Governments of the United Kingdom and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam <br> understand that any bilateral arrangement between the United Kingdom and Viet <br> Nam represents a first step towards seeking this outcome. <br> 2. In the event that the United Kingdom and the European Union reach <br> agreement on rules of origin appropriate for a trilateral approach, the United <br> Kingdom and Viet Nam approve taking the necessary steps, as a matter of urgency, <br> to update the Protocol to the Free Trade Agreement between the United Kingdom of <br> Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam (the \"UK- <br> Viet Nam FTA\") Concerning the Definition of Concepts of \"Originating Products\" <br> and Methods of Administrative Cooperation to reflect a trilateral approach to rules <br> of origin involving the European Union. The necessary steps will be taken in <br> accordance with the procedures of the Trade Committee contained in the UK-Viet <br> Nam FTA. Should the agreement between the United Kingdom and European Union <br> not include the provision of rules of origin suitable for a trilateral approach at entry <br> into force, it is the understanding of both the United Kingdom and Viet Nam that <br> they will endeavour to pursue appropriate discussions with the European Union. <br> 3. This Joint Declaration will come into effect on the entry into effect of the <br> UK-Viet Nam FTA and will continue in operation until terminated in writing by <br> either the United Kingdom or the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. Termination will <br> take effect immediately upon the date of such notification. <br> EXPLANATORY NOTE ON HOW THE UNITED KINGDOM <br> INTERPRETS REFERENCES IN INCORPORATED TRADE <br> AGREEMENTS TO EUROPEAN UNION LAW <br> Existing trade agreements between the European Union (\"EU\") and partner countries <br> contain references to legislation made under the EU Treaties. This includes EU <br> Regulations, Directives and Decisions and EU tertiary legislation adopted pursuant <br> to powers in EU legislation. <br> The mutatis mutandis approach implemented by Article 2 (Incorporation of the EU- <br> Viet Nam FTA) of the Free Trade Agreement between the United Kingdom of Great <br> Britain and Northern Ireland and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam (\"the <br> Agreement\") applies to these references. <br> Except where otherwise provided, references in the Agreement to EU legislation are <br> to be read as references to that EU legislation in force and as incorporated or <br> implemented in the law of the United Kingdom on the day after the United Kingdom <br> ceases to be bound by the relevant EU law. <br> For the United Kingdom, the law of the United Kingdom includes the law of the <br> territories for whose international relations the United Kingdom is responsible and <br> to which the Agreement extends. <br> "}, {"ArticleTitle": "No article title", "ArticleDesc": "Article 15 : General requirements <br> Article 24 : Exemptions from proof of origin <br> Article 30 : Verification of proofs of origin <br> ARTICLE 35 : Committee on Customs <br> Article 4.9 : Advance Rulings <br> Conditions for Making Out an Origin Declaration <br> Verification of Proofs of Origin <br> Committee on Customs <br> Advance Rulings <br> 1.

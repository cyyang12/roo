The first column gives the<br /> heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonised System and the second column gives the<br /> description of goods used in that System for that heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two<br /> columns a rule is specified in column 3. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is<br /> preceded by an \"ex\", this signifies that the rules in column 3 apply only to the part of that heading as<br /> described in column 2. Optional rules in column 4 only apply to textile and clothing products of HS<br /> chapters 50 to 63 exported by MMTZ to SACU under the quota system.<br /> 2.2: Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number is given<br /> and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rules in<br /> columns 3 or 4 apply to all products which, under the Harmonised System, are classified in headings of<br /> the chapter or in any of the headings grouped together in column 1.<br /> 2.3: Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each<br /> indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rules in columns 3<br /> or 4.<br /> Note 3:<br /> 3.1: The provisions of Rule 2 of Annex 1 of this Protocol concerning products having acquired<br /> originating status which are used in the manufacture of other products apply regardless of whether<br /> this status has been acquired inside the factory where these products are used or in another factory in<br /> the Region.<br /> For example\u2022, an engine of heading No 8407, for which the rule may state that the value of<br /> non-originating materials which may be incorporated may not exceed a certain percentage of<br /> the ex-works price, is made from \u2018other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging' of heading No<br /> ex 7224.<br /> If this forging has been forged in the Region from a non-originating ingot, it has already<br /> acquired originating status by virtue of the rule applicable to products of HS chapter 72 in the<br /> list. The forging can then count as originating in the value calculation for the engine regardless<br /> of whether it was produced in the same factory or in another factory in the Region. The value<br /> of the non-originating ingot is thus not taken into account when adding up the value of the<br /> non-originating materials used.<br /> 3.2: The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing required and the<br /> carrying out of more working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the carrying out<br /> of less working or processing cannot confer originating status. Thus if a rule provides that non-<br /> originating material at a certain level of manufacture may be used, the use of such material at an<br /> earlier stage of manufacture is allowed and the use of such material at a later stage is not.<br /> 3.3: When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one<br /> material, this means that any one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all be used.<br /> For example\u2022, the rule for fabrics of heading Nos 5208 to 5212 provides that natural fibres<br /> may be used and that chemical materials, among other materials, may also be used. This<br /> does not mean that both have to be used; it is possible to use one or the other or both.<br /> 3.4: Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular material,<br /> the condition obviously does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their inherent<br /> nature, cannot satisfy the rule. (See also Note 6.2 below in relation to textiles).<br /> For example\u2022, in the case of an article of apparel of ex chapter 62 made from non-woven<br /> materials, if the use of only non-originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is not<br /> possible to start from non-woven cloth, even if non-woven cloths cannot normally be made<br /> from yarn. In such cases, the starting material would normally be at the stage before yarn,<br /> that is the fibre stage.<br /> \u2022 This example is given for the purpose of explanation only. It is not legally binding.<br /> \u2022 These examples are given for the purpose of explanation only. It is not legally binding.<br /> Note 4:<br /> 4.1: The term \"natural fibres\" is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic<br /> fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless<br /> otherwise specified, includes fibres that have been carded, combed or otherwise processed but not<br /> spun.<br /> 4.2: The term \"natural fibres\" includes horsehair of heading No 0503, silk of heading Nos. 5002 and<br /> 5003 as well as the wool fibres, fine or coarse animal hair of heading Nos. 5101 to 5105, the cotton<br /> fibres of heading Nos. 5201 to 5203 and the other vegetable fibres of heading Nos. 5301 to 5305.<br /> 4.3: The terms \"textile pulp\", \"chemical materials\" and \"paper-making materials\" are used in the list to<br /> describe the materials not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to manufacture artificial,<br /> synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.<br /> 4.4: The term \"man-made staple fibres\" is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament<br /> tow, staple fibres or waste, of heading Nos. 5501 to 5507.<br /> Note 5:<br /> 5.1: The conditions set out in column 3 or 4 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials, used in<br /> the manufacture of this product, which, taken together, represent 10 per cent or less of the total<br /> weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 5.3 and 5.4 below).<br /> 5.2: However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 5.1 may only be applied to mixed products which have<br /> been made from two or more basic textile materials.<br /> The following are the basic textile materials:<br /> - silk,<br /> - wool,<br /> - coarse animal hair,<br /> - fine animal hair,<br /> - horsehair,<br /> - cotton,<br /> - paper-making materials and paper,<br /> - flax,<br /> - true hemp,<br /> - jute and other textile bast fibres,<br /> - sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave,<br /> - coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,<br /> - synthetic man-made filaments, artificial man-made filaments,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyphenylene sulphide,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyvinyl chloride,<br /> - other synthetic man-made staple fibres,<br /> - artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose,<br /> - other artificial man-made staple fibres,<br /> - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether whether or not gimped,<br /> - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester whether or not gimped,<br /> - products of heading No 5605<br /> aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width<br /> not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two<br /> layers of plastic film,<br /> - other products of heading No 5605.<br /> For example\u2022, a yarn of heading No 5205 made from cotton fibres of heading No 5203 and<br /> synthetic staple fibres of heading No 5506 is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic<br /> staple fibres that do not satisfy the origin rules (which may require manufacture from chemical<br /> materials or textile pulp) may be used up to a weight of ten per cent of the yarn.<br /> For example\u2022, a woollen fabric of heading No 5112 made from woollen yarn of heading No 5107<br /> and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading No 5509 is a mixed fabric. Therefore, synthetic yarn<br /> which does not satisfy the origin rules (which may require manufacture from chemical materials or<br /> textile pulp) or woolen yarn that does not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from<br /> natural fibres, not carded or combed or other otherwise prepared for spinning) or a combination of<br /> the two may be used provided their total weight does not exceed ten per cent of the weight of the<br /> fabric.<br /> For example\u2022, tufted textile fabric of heading No 5802 made from cotton yarn of heading No 5205<br /> \u2022 These examples are given for the purpose of explanation only. It is not legally binding.<br /> and cotton fabric of heading No 5210 is only a mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed<br /> fabric being made from yarns classified in two separate headings or if the cotton yarn used are<br /> themselves mixtures.<br /> For example\u2022, if the tufted fabric concerned has been made from cotton yarn of heading No 5205<br /> and synthetic fabric of heading No 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic<br /> textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is accordingly a mixed product.<br /> 5.3: In case of products incorporating \"yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments<br /> of polyether whether or not gimped\" this tolerance is 20 per cent in respect of this yarn.<br /> 5.4: In the case of products incorporating \"strip consisting of a core of aluminum foil or of a core of<br /> plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched<br /> by means of an adhesive between two layers of plastic film\", this tolerance is 30 per cent in respect of<br /> this strip.<br /> Note 6:<br /> 6.1: Textile materials, with the exception of linings and interlinings, which do not satisfy the rule set<br /> out in the list in column 3 or 4 for the made-up product concerned may be used provided that they are<br /> classified in a heading other than that of the product and that their value does not exceed 8 per cent<br /> of the ex-works price of the product.<br /> 6.2: Without prejudice to Note 6.3, materials which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63 may be<br /> used freely in the manufacture of textile products, whether or not they contain textiles.<br /> For example\u2022, if a rule in the list provides that for particular textile items yarn must be used,<br /> this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because buttons are not<br /> classified within chapters 50 to 63. For the same reason, it does not prevent the use of slide-<br /> fasteners, even though slide-fasteners normally contain textiles.<br /> 6.3: Where a percentage rule applies, the value of materials which are not classified within Chapters<br /> 50 to 63 must be taken into account when calculating the value of the non-originating materials<br /> incorporated.<br /> \u2022 This example is given for the purpose of explanation only. It is not legally binding.<br /> Note 7:<br /> CHEMICAL PROCESSING RULES TO CONFER ORIGINATING STATUS<br /> Section VI<br /> Products of the Chemical or Allied Industries (Chapter 28-38)<br /> Notes to Section VI:<br /> Note 1<br /> 7.1: Rules 1 through 7 of this Section confer origin to a good of any chapter or heading in this<br /> Section, except as otherwise specified in those rules.<br /> Note 2<br /> 7.2: Notwithstanding Note 1, a good is originating if it meets the applicable change in tariff<br /> classification or the percentage value content of non-originating material specified in Appendix<br /> I of Annex I of the Protocol on trade.<br /> Rule 1: Chemical Reaction Origin<br /> 7.3: For a good of Chapters 28 through 38, which is subject to a chemical reaction, shall be<br /> treated as an originating good if the chemical reaction occurred in the territory of one or more<br /> of the Parties.<br /> 7.4: Note: For purposes of this section, a \"chemical reaction\" is a process (including a<br /> biochemical process) that results in a molecule with a new structure by breaking intramolecular<br /> bonds and by forming new intramolecular bonds, or by altering the spatial arrangement of<br /> atoms in a molecule.<br /> 7.5: The following are not considered to be chemical reactions for the purposes of determining<br /> whether a product is an originating good:<br /> (a) dissolution in water or in other solvents;<br /> (b) the elimination of solvents including solvent water; or<br /> (c) the addition or elimination of water of crystallization.<br /> Rule 2: Purification Origin<br /> 7.6: For a good of chapters 28 through 38, a good that is subject to purification shall be<br /> treated as originating provided that one of the following occurs in the territory of one or more<br /> of the Parties:<br /> (a) Purification of a good resulting in the elimination of 80 percent of the content of<br /> existing impurities; or<br /> (b) The reduction or elimination of impurities resulting in a good suitable for one or more<br /> of the following applications:<br /> (i) Pharmaceutical, medicinal, cosmetic, veterinary, or food grade substances;<br /> (ii) Chemical products and reagents for analytical, diagnostic or laboratory uses;<br /> (iii) Elements and components for use in micro-elements;<br /> (iv) Specialized optical uses;<br /> (v) Non toxic uses for health and safety;<br /> (vi) Biotechnical use;<br /> (vii) Carriers used in a separation process; or<br /> (viii) Nuclear grade uses.<br /> Rule 3: Mixtures and Blends<br /> 7.7: A good of chapters 30, 31, 33 through 38 except for heading 38.08, shall be treated as<br /> originating if the deliberate and proportionally controlled mixing or blending (including<br /> dispersing) of materials to conform to predetermined specifications which results in the<br /> production of a good having physical or chemical characteristics which are relevant to the<br /> purposes or uses of the good and are different from the input materials, occurs in the territory<br /> of one or more of the Parties.<br /> Rule 4: Change in Particle Size<br /> 7.8: A good of chapters 30, 31, and 33, shall be treated as originating if the following occurs in<br /> the territory of one or more of the Parties: the deliberate and controlled modification in particle<br /> size of a good, including micronizing by dissolving a polymer and subsequent precipitation,<br /> other than by merely crushing or pressing, resulting in a good having a defined particle size,<br /> defined particle size distribution or defined surface area, which is relevant to the purposes of<br /> the resulting good and have different physical or chemical characteristics from the input<br /> materials is considered to be origin conferring.<br /> Rule 5: Standards Materials<br /> 7.9: A good of chapters 28 through 38, shall be treated as originating if the production of these<br /> materials occurs in the territory of one or more of the Parties.<br /> 7.10: For the purposes of this rule \"standards materials\" (including standard solutions) are<br /> preparations suitable for analytical, calibrating or referencing uses and having precise degrees<br /> of purity or proportions, which are certified by the manufacturer.<br /> Rule 6: Isomer Separation<br /> 7.11: A good of chapters 28 through 38, shall be treated as originating if the isolation or<br /> separation of isomers from mixtures of isomers occurs in the territory of one or more of the<br /> Parties.<br /> Rule 7: Separation Prohibition<br /> 7.12: A good that undergoes a change from one classification to another in the territory of one<br /> or more of the Parties as a result of the separation of one or more materials from a man-made<br /> mixture shall not be treated as originating unless the isolated material underwent a chemical<br /> reaction in the territory of one or more of the Parties.", "ShowProductAffected": false, "ProductAffected": null, "RevisionName": null, "Rank": 0, "ShowRooExceptions": false, "RooExceptions": null}], "SpecificNote": [{"RooCode": null, "RooText": null, "ShowProductAffected": false, "ProductAffected": null, "RevisionName": null, "Rank": 0, "ShowRooExceptions": false, "RooExceptions": null}], "Documents": [{"DocDesc": "Certificate of origin", "DocFileName": "itc00675_coo.pdf", "DocType": "1_coo", "WebLink": null}, {"DocDesc": "Product-specific rules of origin", "DocFileName": "itc00675_sroo.pdf", "DocType": "2_sroo", "WebLink": "https://www.mcci.org/media/1285/sadc_protocol_annex_i.pdf"}, {"DocDesc": "Chapter on rules of origin", "DocFileName": "itc00675_roo.pdf", "DocType": "3_roo", "WebLink": "https://www.mcci.org/media/1285/sadc_protocol_annex_i.pdf"}, {"DocDesc": "Full text of agreement", "DocFileName": "itc00675_full.pdf", "DocType": "8_full", "WebLink": "https://www.sadc.int/files/5314/4559/5701/Consolidated_Text_of_the_SADC_Treaty_-_scanned_21_October_2015.pdf"}]}, "FtaProvisions": {"RooProvision": [{"ProvisionAbbrev": "accum", "ProvisionCode": "Cumulation", "ProvisionValue": "diagonal", "ProvisionRank": null, "ProvisionGlossary": "A provision which allows to consider goods obtained in as well as processing taking place in one FTA member country as originating in another.", "ProvisionGlossaryLink": "/en/glossary?uid=accum&returnto=gloscenter", "ProvisionLegalExtract": "RULE 2: ORIGIN CRITERIA <br /> 4 Cumulative treatment <br /> (a) For the purposes of implementing this Annex, the Member States shall be considered as one territory. <br /> (b) Raw materials or semi-finished goods originating in accordance with the provisions of this Annex <br /> in any of the Member States and undergoing working or processing either in one or more Member <br /> States shall, for the purpose of determining the origin of a finished product, be deemed to have <br /> originated in the Member State where the final processing or manufacturing takes place.", "ProvisionValueCssClass": "", "ProvisionDisplayCssClass": null}, {"ProvisionAbbrev": "demin", "ProvisionCode": "De Minimis", "ProvisionValue": "included (15%)", "ProvisionRank": null, "ProvisionGlossary": "A provision that allows a small amount of non-originating materials to be used in the production of the good without affecting its originating status.

Such further verification should be made within three months of the <br> request being made by a competent authority designated by the importing Member State. The <br> form used for this purpose shall be that contained in Appendix IV to this Annex. <br> 4 The importing Member State shall not prevent the importer from taking delivery of goods solely <br> on the grounds that it requires further evidence, but may require security for any duty or other <br> charge which may be payable: provided that where goods are subject to any prohibitions, the <br> conditions for delivery under security shall not apply. <br> 5 Copies of certificates of origin and other relevant documentary evidence shall be preserved by <br> the appropriate authorities of the Member States for at least five years. <br> 6 All Member States shall deposit with the Secretariat the names of Departments and Agencies <br> authorized to issue the certificates required under this Annex, specimen signatures of officials <br> authorized to sign the certificates and the impressions of the official stamps to be used for that <br> purpose, and those shall be circulated to the Member States by the Secretariat. <br> RULE 10: INFRINGEMENT AND PENALTIES <br> 1 The Member States undertake to introduce legislation where such legislation does not exist, <br> making such provision as may be necessary for penalties against persons who, in their <br> territories, furnish or cause to be furnished documents which are untrue in any material sense, <br> particularly in support of a claim in another Member State. <br> 2 Any Member State to which an untrue claim is made in respect of the origin of goods shall <br> immediately bring the issue to the attention of the exporting Member State from which the <br> untrue claim is made, in accordance with the provisions on mutual assistance and co-operation <br> in customs matters as contained in Appendix I of Annex II of this Protocol. <br> 3 Continued infringement by a Member State of the provisions of this Annex may be dealt with in <br> accordance with the provisions of Annex VI of this Protocol. <br> ANNEX I <br> "}, {"ArticleTitle": "DEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATION", "ArticleDesc": "RULE 1: DEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATION <br> 1.

Where <br> containers are not to be returned, they shall be treated separately from the goods contained in <br> them and be subjected to Customs duties and other charges of equivalent effect. <br> RULE 9: DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE <br> 1 The claim that goods shall be accepted as originating from a Member State in accordance with <br> the provision of this Annex shall be supported by a certificate given by the exporter or their <br> authorized representative in the form prescribed in Appendix II of this Annex.

The first<br /> column gives the heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonized System<br /> and the second column gives the description of goods used in that system for that<br /> heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in<br /> column 3 or 4. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an<br /> 'ex', this signifies that the rules in column 3 or 4 apply only to the part of that heading<br /> as described in column 2.<br /> 2.2 Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter<br /> number is given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in<br /> general terms, the adjacent rules in column 3 or 4 apply to all products which, under<br /> the Harmonized System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in any of the<br /> headings grouped together in column 1.<br /> 2.3 Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within<br /> a heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by<br /> the adjacent rules in column 3 or 4.<br /> 2.4 Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both<br /> columns 3 and 4, the exporter may opt, as an alternative, to apply either the rule set<br /> out in column 3 or that set out in column 4. If no origin rule is given in column 4, the<br /> rule set out in column 3 is to be applied.<br /> Note 3:<br /> 3.1 The provisions of Article 5 of the Annex, concerning products having acquired<br /> originating status which are used in the manufacture of other products, shall apply,<br /> regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where these<br /> products are used or in another factory in a State Party.<br /> Example:<br /> An engine of heading 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-<br /> originating materials which may be incorporated may not exceed 40 per cent<br /> of the ex-works price, is made from \"other alloy steel roughly shaped by<br /> forging\" of heading ex 7224.<br /> If this forging has been forged in the State Party concerned from a non-<br /> originating ingot, it has already acquired originating status by virtue of the rule<br /> for heading ex 7224 in the list. The forging can then count as originating in<br /> the value-calculation for the engine, regardless of whether it was produced in<br /> the same factory or in another factory in the State Party concerned. The value<br /> of the non-originating ingot is thus not taken into account when adding up the<br /> value of the non-originating materials used.<br /> 3.2 The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing<br /> required, and the carrying-out of more working or processing also confers originating<br /> status; conversely, the carrying-out of less working or processing cannot confer<br /> originating status. Thus, if a rule provides that non-originating material, at a certain<br /> level of manufacture, may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of<br /> manufacture is allowed, and the use of such material at a later stage is not.<br /> 3.3 Without prejudice to Note 3.2, where a rule uses the expression \"Manufacture<br /> from materials of any heading\", then materials of any heading(s) (even materials of<br /> the same description and heading as the product) may be used, subject, however, to<br /> any specific limitations which may also be contained in the rule.<br /> However, the expression \"Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other<br /> materials of heading ...\" or \"Manufacture from materials of any heading, including<br /> other materials of the same heading as the product\" means that materials of any<br /> heading(s) may be used, except those of the same description as the product as given<br /> in column 2 of the list.<br /> 3.4 When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from<br /> more than one material, this means that one or more materials may be used. It does<br /> not require that all be used.<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for fabrics of headings 5306 to 5308 provides that natural fibres may<br /> be used and that chemical materials, among other materials, may also be used.<br /> This does not mean that both have to be used; it is possible to use one or the<br /> other, or both.<br /> 3.5 Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a<br /> particular material, the condition obviously does not prevent the use of other materials<br /> which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule. (See also Note 6.2<br /> below in relation to textiles).<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for prepared foods of heading 1904, which specifically excludes the<br /> use of cereals and their derivatives, does not prevent the use of mineral salts,<br /> chemicals and other additives which are not products from cereals.<br /> However, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be<br /> manufactured from the particular materials specified in the list, can be<br /> produced from a material of the same nature at an earlier stage of manufacture.<br /> Example:<br /> In the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 made from non-woven<br /> materials, if the use of only non-originating yarn is allowed for this class of<br /> article, it is not possible to start from non-woven cloth - even if non-woven<br /> cloths cannot normally be made from yarn. In such cases, the starting material<br /> would normally be at the stage before yarn - that is, the fibre stage.<br /> 3.6 Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value<br /> of non-originating materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be<br /> added together. In other words, the maximum value of all the non-originating<br /> materials used may never exceed the higher of the percentages given. Furthermore,<br /> the individual percentages must not be exceeded, in relation to the particular materials<br /> to which they apply.<br /> Note 4:<br /> 4.1 The term \"natural fibres\" is used in the list to refer to fibres other than<br /> artificial or synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place,<br /> including waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres that have been<br /> carded, combed or otherwise processed, but not spun.<br /> 4.2 The term \"natural fibres\" includes horsehair of heading 0503, silk of headings<br /> 5002 and 5003, as well as the wool-fibres and fine or coarse animal hair of headings<br /> 5101 to 5105, cotton fibres of headings 5201 to 5203, and the other vegetable fibres of<br /> headings 5301 to 5305.<br /> 4.3 The terms \"textile pulp\", \"chemical materials\" and \"paper-making materials\"<br /> are used in the list to describe the materials, not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which<br /> can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.<br /> 4.4 The term \"man-made staple fibres\" is used in the list to refer to synthetic or<br /> artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of headings 5501 to 5507.<br /> Note 5:<br /> 5.1 Where, for a given product in the list, a reference is made to this Note, the<br /> conditions set out in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials used<br /> in the manufacture of this product and which, taken together, represent ten per cent or<br /> less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 5.3 and<br /> 5.4 below).<br /> 5.2.1 However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 5.1 may be applied only to mixed<br /> products which have been made from two or more basic textile materials.<br /> 5.2.2 The following are the basic textile materials:<br /> - silk,<br /> - wool,<br /> - coarse animal hair,<br /> - fine animal hair,<br /> - horsehair,<br /> - cotton,<br /> - paper-making materials and paper,<br /> - flax,<br /> - true hemp,<br /> - jute and other textile bast fibres,<br /> - sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave,<br /> - coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,<br /> - synthetic man-made filaments,<br /> - artificial man-made filaments,<br /> - current-conducting filaments,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(phenylene sulphide),<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(vinyl chloride),<br /> - other synthetic man-made staple fibres,<br /> - artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose,<br /> - other artificial man-made staple fibres,<br /> - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether,<br /> whether or not gimped,<br /> - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester,<br /> whether or not gimped,<br /> - products of heading 5605 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a<br /> core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with<br /> aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a<br /> transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film,<br /> - other products of heading 5605.<br /> Example:<br /> A yarn, of heading 5205, made from cotton fibres of heading 5203 and<br /> synthetic staple fibres of heading 5506, is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-<br /> originating synthetic staple fibres which do not satisfy the origin-rules (which<br /> require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) may be used,<br /> provided that their total weight does not exceed ten per cent of the weight of<br /> the yarn.<br /> Example:<br /> A cotton yarn, of heading 5204, made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and<br /> synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading 5509, is a mixed yarn. Therefore,<br /> synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules (which require<br /> manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp), or woollen yarn which<br /> does not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from natural<br /> fibres, not carded or combed or otherwise prepared for spinning), or a<br /> combination of the two, may be used, provided their total weight does not<br /> exceed ten per cent of the weight of the fabric.<br /> Example:<br /> Tufted textile fabric, of heading 5802, made from cotton yarn of heading 5205<br /> and cotton fabric of heading 5210, is only mixed product if the cotton fabric is<br /> itself a mixed fabric made from yarns classified in two separate headings, or if<br /> the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.<br /> Example:<br /> If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of<br /> heading 5205 and synthetic fabric of heading 5407, then, obviously, the yarns<br /> used are two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is,<br /> accordingly, a mixed product.<br /> 5.3 In the case of products incorporating \"yarn made of polyurethane segmented<br /> with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped\", this tolerance is 20 per<br /> cent in respect of this yarn.<br /> 5.4 In the case of products incorporating \"strip consisting of a core of aluminium<br /> foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a<br /> width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured<br /> adhesive between two layers of plastic film\", this tolerance is 30 per cent in respect of<br /> this strip.<br /> Note 6:<br /> 6.1 Where, in the list, reference is made to this Note, textile materials (with the<br /> exception of linings and interlinings), which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in<br /> column 3 for the made-up product concerned, may be used, provided that they are<br /> classified in a heading other than that of the product and that their value does not<br /> exceed eight per cent of the ex-works price of the product.<br /> 6.2 Without prejudice to Note 6.3, materials, which are not classified within<br /> Chapters 50 to 63, may be used freely in the manufacture of textile products, whether<br /> or not they contain textiles.<br /> Example:<br /> If a rule in the list provides that, for a particular textile item (such as trousers),<br /> yarn must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as<br /> buttons, because buttons are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63. For the<br /> same reason, it does not prevent the use of slide-fasteners, even though slide-<br /> fasteners normally contain textiles.<br /> 6.3 Where a percentage-rule applies, the value of materials, which are not<br /> classified within Chapters 50 to 63, must also be taken into account when calculating<br /> the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.<br /> Note 7<br /> 7.1 For the purposes of headings ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex<br /> 3403, the \"specific processes\" are the following:<br /> (a) vacuum-distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;<br /> (c) cracking;<br /> (d) reforming;<br /> (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f) the process comprising all of the following operations: processing with<br /> concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride;<br /> neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification<br /> with naturally active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or<br /> bauxite;<br /> (g) polymerisation;<br /> (h) alkylation;<br /> (i) isomerisation.<br /> 7.2 For the purposes of headings 2710, 2711 and 2712, the \"specific processes\"<br /> are the following:<br /> (a) vacuum-distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;<br /> (c) cracking;<br /> (d) reforming;<br /> (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f) the process comprising all of the following operations: processing with<br /> concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride;<br /> neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification<br /> with naturally-active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or<br /> bauxite;<br /> (g) polymerisation;<br /> (h) alkylation;<br /> (ij) isomerisation;<br /> (k) in respect of heavy oils of heading ex 2710 only, desulphurisation with<br /> hydrogen, resulting in a reduction of at least 85 per cent of the sulphur-<br /> content of the products processed (ASTM D 1266-59 T method);<br /> (l) in respect of products of heading 2710 only, deparaffining by a process<br /> other than filtering;<br /> (m) in respect of heavy oils of heading ex 2710 only, treatment with<br /> hydrogen, at a pressure of more than 20 bar and a temperature of more<br /> than 250\u00b0C, with the use of a catalyst, other than to effect<br /> desulphurisation, when the hydrogen constitutes an active element in a<br /> chemical reaction.

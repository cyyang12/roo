The first column gives the<br /> heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonised System and the second column<br /> gives the description of goods used in that system for that heading or chapter. For each entry in<br /> the first two columns, a rule is specified in columns 3 or 4. Where, in some cases, the entry in<br /> the first column is preceded by an \u2018ex', this signifies that the rules in columns 3 or 4 apply only<br /> to the part of that heading as described in column 2.<br /> 2 Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number is given<br /> and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent<br /> rules in column 3 or 4 apply to all products which, under the Harmonised System, are classified<br /> in headings of the chapter or in any of the headings grouped together in column 1.<br /> 3 Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each<br /> indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rules in<br /> columns 3 or 4.<br /> 4 Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns 3 and 4, the<br /> exporter may opt to apply either the rule set out in column 3 or that set out in column 4. If no<br /> origin rule is given in column 4, the rule set out in column 3 has to be applied.<br /> Note 3:<br /> 1 The provisions of Article 4 of this Protocol, concerning products having acquired originating<br /> status which are used in the manufacture of other products, apply regardless of whether this<br /> status has been acquired inside the factory where these products are used or in another factory<br /> in the United Kingdom or in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire.<br /> For example:<br /> An engine of heading 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-originating<br /> materials which may be incorporated may not exceed 40% of the ex-works price, is made from<br /> \u2018other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging' of heading ex 7224.<br /> If that forging has been forged in the United Kingdom from a non-originating ingot, it has<br /> already acquired originating status by virtue of the rule for heading ex 7224 in the list. The<br /> forging can then count as originating in the value calculation for the engine, regardless of<br /> whether it was produced in the same factory or in another factory in the United Kingdom. The<br /> value of the non-originating ingot is thus not taken into account when adding up the value of<br /> the non-originating materials used.<br /> carrying out of more working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the<br /> carrying out of less working or processing cannot confer originating status. In other words, if a<br /> rule provides that non-originating material, at a certain level of manufacture, may be used, the<br /> use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed, and the use of such material<br /> at a later stage is not.<br /> materials of the same heading as the product may also be used, subject, however, to any specific<br /> limitations which may also be contained in the rule. However, the expression \u2018manufacture<br /> from materials of any heading, including other materials of heading \u2026' means that only<br /> materials classified in the same heading as the product of a description other than that of the<br /> product as given in column 2 of the list may be used.<br /> material, this means that one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all be used.<br /> For example:<br /> The rule for fabrics of headings 5208 to 5212 indicates that natural fibres may be used and that<br /> chemical materials, among other materials, may also be used. This does not mean that both have<br /> to be used; it is possible to use one or the other or both.<br /> the condition obviously does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their<br /> inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule (see also Note 6.3 below in relation to textiles). For<br /> example:<br /> The rule for prepared foods of heading 1904, which specifically excludes the use of cereals and<br /> their derivatives, does not prevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and other additives which<br /> are not produced from cereals.<br /> However, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be manufactured from<br /> the particular materials specified in the list, can be produced from a material of the same nature<br /> at an earlier stage of manufacture.<br /> For example:<br /> In the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 of the Harmonised System made from non-<br /> woven materials, if the use of only non-originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is<br /> not possible to start from non-woven cloth - even if non-woven cloths cannot normally be made<br /> from yarn. In such cases, the starting material would normally be at the stage before yarn - that<br /> is the fibre stage.<br /> materials that can be used, then those percentages may not be added together. In other words,<br /> the maximum value of all the non-originating materials used may never exceed the higher of<br /> the percentages given. Furthermore, the individual percentages must not be exceeded in relation<br /> to the particular materials to which they apply.<br /> Note 4:<br /> 1 The term \u2018natural fibres' is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic<br /> fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless<br /> otherwise specified, includes fibres which have been carded, combed or otherwise processed,<br /> but not spun.<br /> 2 The term \u2018natural fibres' includes horsehair of heading 0511, silk of headings 5002 and 5003<br /> as well as wool fibres and fine or coarse animal hair of headings 5101 to 5105, cotton fibres of<br /> headings 5201 to 5203 and other vegetable fibres of headings 5301 to 5305.<br /> 3 The terms \u2018textile pulp', \u2018chemical materials' and \u2018paper-making materials' are used in the list<br /> to describe the materials not classified in Chapters 50 to 63 of the Harmonised System which<br /> can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.<br /> 4 The term \u2018man-made staple fibres' is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament<br /> tow, staple fibres or waste, of headings 5501 to 5507.<br /> Note 5:<br /> 1 Where, for a given product in the list, reference is made to this Note, the conditions set out in<br /> column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials used in the manufacture of this<br /> product, which, taken together, represent 10% or less of the total weight of all the basic textile<br /> materials used (see also Notes 5.3 and 5.4 below.)<br /> 2 However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 5.1 may only be applied to mixed products which<br /> have been made from two or more basic textile materials.<br /> The following are the basic textile materials:<br /> - silk,<br /> - wool,<br /> - coarse animal hair,<br /> - fine animal hair,<br /> - horsehair,<br /> - cotton,<br /> - paper-making materials and paper,<br /> - flax,<br /> - true hemp,<br /> - jute and other textile bast fibres,<br /> - sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave,<br /> - coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,<br /> - synthetic man-made filaments,<br /> - artificial man-made filaments,<br /> - current conducting filaments,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyphenylene sulphide,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyvinyl chloride,<br /> - other synthetic man-made staple fibres,<br /> - artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose,<br /> - other artificial man-made staple fibres,<br /> - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether whether or not<br /> gimped,<br /> - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester whether or not<br /> gimped,<br /> - products of heading 5605 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core of<br /> aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder,<br /> of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured<br /> adhesive between two layers of plastic film,<br /> - other products of heading 5605.<br /> For example:<br /> A yarn of heading 5205 made from cotton fibres of heading 5203 and synthetic staple fibres of<br /> heading 5506 is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres that do not satisfy<br /> the origin rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) may be used<br /> up to a weight of 10% of the yarn.<br /> For example:<br /> A woollen fabric of heading 5112 made from woollen yarn of heading 5107 and synthetic yarn of<br /> staple fibres of heading 5509 is a mixed fabric. Therefore, synthetic yarn which does not satisfy<br /> the origin rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) or woollen<br /> yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from natural fibres, not<br /> carded or combed or otherwise prepared for spinning) or a combination of the two may be used,<br /> provided that their total weight does not exceed 10% of the weight of the fabric.<br /> For example:<br /> Tufted textile fabric of heading 5802 made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and cotton fabric of<br /> heading 5210 is only a mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric made from yarns<br /> classified in two separate headings or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.<br /> For example:<br /> If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and synthetic<br /> fabric of heading 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic textile materials and<br /> the tufted textile fabric is, accordingly, a mixed product.<br /> segments of polyether, whether or not gimped', the tolerance is 20% in respect of this yarn.<br /> of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm,<br /> sandwiched by means of an adhesive between two layers of plastic film', the tolerance is 30 %<br /> in respect of the strip.<br /> Note 6:<br /> Introductory Note, textile trimmings and accessories which do not satisfy the rule set out in the<br /> list in column 3 for the made up products concerned may be used provided that their weight<br /> does not exceed 10% of the total weight of all the textile materials incorporated.<br /> The textile trimmings and accessories concerned are those classified in Chapters 50 to 63 of the<br /> Harmonised System. Linings and interlinings are not be regarded as trimmings or accessories.<br /> have to satisfy the conditions set out in column 3 even though they fall outside the scope of<br /> Note 3.5.<br /> product which do not contain any textiles may, in all cases, be used freely where they cannot<br /> be made from the materials listed in column 3.<br /> For example1, if a rule in the list says that for a particular textile item, such as a blouse, yarn<br /> must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because they cannot<br /> be made from textile materials.<br /> account when calculating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.<br /> Note 7:<br /> \u2018specific processes' are as follows:<br /> (a) vacuum distillation;<br /> 1 This example is given for explanatory purposes only.

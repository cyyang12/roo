The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column<br /> gives the heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonized System and<br /> the second column gives the description of goods used in that system for that<br /> heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in<br /> column 3 or 4. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by<br /> an \"ex\", this signifies that the rules in column 3 or 4 apply only to the part of that<br /> heading as described in column 2.<br /> 2.2. Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter<br /> number is given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in<br /> general terms, the adjacent rules in column 3 or 4 apply to all products which,<br /> under the Harmonized System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in any<br /> of the headings grouped together in column 1.<br /> 2.3. Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a<br /> heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered<br /> by the adjacent rules in column 3 or 4.<br /> 2.4. Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns 3<br /> and 4, the exporter may opt, as an alternative, to apply either the rule set out in<br /> column 3 or that set out in column 4. If no origin rule is given in column 4, the<br /> rule set out in column 3 is to be applied.<br /> Note 3:<br /> 3.1. The provisions of Article 6 of the Protocol, concerning products having acquired<br /> originating status which are used in the manufacture of other products, shall<br /> apply, regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where<br /> these products are used or in another factory in a contracting party.<br /> Example:<br /> An engine of heading 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-<br /> originating materials which may be incorporated may not exceed 40 % of the ex-<br /> works price, is made from \"other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging\" of<br /> heading ex 7224.<br /> If this forging has been forged in Turkey from a non-originating ingot, it has<br /> already acquired originating status by virtue of the rule for heading ex 7224 in the<br /> list. The forging can then count as originating in the value-calculation for the<br /> engine, regardless of whether it was produced in the same factory or in another<br /> factory in Turkey. The value of the non-originating ingot is thus not taken into<br /> account when adding up the value of the non-originating materials used.<br /> 3.2. The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing<br /> required,  and the carrying-out of more working or processing also confers<br /> originating status; conversely, the carrying-out of less working or processing<br /> cannot confer originating status. Thus, if a rule provides that non-originating<br /> material, at a certain level of manufacture, may be used, the use of such material<br /> at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed, and the use of such material at a<br /> later stage is not.<br /> 3.3. Without prejudice to Note 3.2, where a rule uses the expression \"Manufacture<br /> from materials of any heading\", then materials of any heading(s) (even materials<br /> of the same description and heading as the product) may be used, subject,<br /> however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in the rule.<br /> However, the expression \"Manufacture from materials of any heading, including<br /> other materials of heading ...\" or \"Manufacture from materials of any heading,<br /> including other materials of the same heading as the product\" means that materials<br /> of any heading(s) may be used, except those of the same description as the<br /> product as given in column 2 of the list.<br /> 3.4.<br /> than one material, this means that one or more materials may be used. It does not<br /> require that all be used.<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for fabrics of headings 5208 to 5212 provides that natural fibres may be<br /> used and that chemical materials, among other materials, may also be used. This<br /> does not mean that both have to be used; it is possible to use one or the other, or<br /> both.<br /> 3.5.<br /> particular material, the condition obviously does not prevent the use of other<br /> materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule. (See also<br /> Note 6.2 below in relation to textiles).<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for prepared foods of heading 1904, which specifically excludes the use<br /> of cereals and their derivatives, does not prevent the use of mineral salts,<br /> chemicals and other additives which are not products from cereals.<br /> However,  this  does not apply to products which, although they cannot be<br /> manufactured from the particular materials specified in the list, can be produced<br /> from a material of the same nature at an earlier stage of manufacture.<br /> Example:<br /> In the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 made from non-woven<br /> materials, if the use of only non-originating yarn is allowed for this class of<br /> article, it is not possible to start from non-woven cloth - even if non-woven cloths<br /> cannot normally be made from yarn. In such cases, the starting material would<br /> normally be at the stage before yarn - that is, the fibre stage.<br /> 3.6.<br /> non-originating materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be<br /> added together. In other words, the maximum value of all the non-originating<br /> materials  used  may  never  exceed  the  higher  of  the  percentages  given.<br /> Furthermore, the individual percentages must not be exceeded, in relation to the<br /> particular materials to which they apply.<br /> Note 4:<br /> 4.1.<br /> synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including<br /> waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres which have been carded,<br /> combed or otherwise processed, but not spun.<br /> 4.2.<br /> headings 5002 and 5003, as well as wool-fibres and fine or coarse animal hair of<br /> headings 5101  to 5105,  cotton  fibres  of  headings 5201  to 5203,  and  other<br /> vegetable fibres of headings 5301 to 5305.<br /> 4.3.<br /> used in the list to describe the materials, not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which<br /> can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.<br /> 4.4. The term \"man-made staple fibres\" is used in the list to refer to synthetic or<br /> artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of headings 5501 to 5507.<br /> Note 5:<br /> 5.1. Where, for a given product in the list, reference is made to this Note, the<br /> conditions set out in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials<br /> used in the manufacture of this product and which, taken together, represent 10 %<br /> or less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used.<br /> Notes 5.3 and 5.4 below.)<br /> 5.2. However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 5.1 may be applied only to mixed<br /> products which have been made from two or more basic textile materials.<br /> The following are the basic textile materials:<br /> - silk,<br /> - wool,<br /> - coarse animal hair,<br /> - fine animal hair,<br /> - horsehair,<br /> - cotton,<br /> - paper-making materials and paper,<br /> - flax,<br /> - true hemp,<br /> - jute and other textile bast fibres,<br /> - sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave,<br /> - coconut, abaca , ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,<br /> - synthetic man-made filaments,<br /> - artificial man-made filaments,<br /> - current-conducting filaments,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(phenylene sulphide),<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(vinyl chloride),<br /> - other synthetic man-made staple fibres,<br /> - artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose,<br /> - other artificial man-made staple fibres,<br /> - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of<br /> whether or not gimped,<br /> - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester,<br /> whether or not gimped,<br /> - products of heading 5605 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a<br /> core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with<br /> aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a<br /> transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film,<br /> - other products of heading 5605.<br /> Example:<br /> A yarn, of heading 5205, made from cotton fibres of heading 5203 and synthetic<br /> staple  fibres  of  heading 5506,  is  a  mixed  yarn.  Therefore,  non-originating<br /> synthetic  staple fibres which do not satisfy the origin-rules<br /> manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) may be used, provided that<br /> their total weight does not exceed 10 % of the weight of the yarn.<br /> Example:<br /> A woollen fabric, of heading 5112, made from woollen yarn of heading 5107 and<br /> synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading 5509, is a mixed fabric. Therefore,<br /> synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the origin-rules (which require manufacture<br /> from chemical materials or textile pulp), or woollen yarn which does not satisfy<br /> the origin-rules (which require manufacture from natural fibres, not carded or<br /> combed or otherwise prepared for spinning), or a combination of the two, may be<br /> used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10 % of the weight of the<br /> fabric.<br /> Example:<br /> Tufted textile fabric, of heading 5802, made from cotton yarn of heading 5205<br /> and cotton fabric of heading 5210, is a only mixed product if the cotton fabric is<br /> itself a mixed fabric made from yarns classified in two separate headings, or if the<br /> cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.<br /> Example:<br /> If the  tufted  textile  fabric concerned had been  made from  cotton yarn of<br /> heading 5205 and synthetic fabric of heading 5407, then, obviously, the yarns<br /> used are two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is,<br /> accordingly, a mixed product.<br /> 5.3. In the case of products incorporating \"yarn made of polyurethane segmented with<br /> flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped\", this tolerance is 20 % in<br /> respect of this yarn.<br /> 5.4. In the case of products incorporating \"strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil<br /> or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a<br /> width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured<br /> adhesive between two layers of plastic film\", this tolerance is 30 % in respect of<br /> this strip.<br /> Note 6:<br /> 6.1. Where, in the list, reference is made to this Note, textile materials (with the<br /> exception of linings and interlinings), which do not satisfy the rule set out in the<br /> list in column 3 for the made-up product concerned, may be used, provided that<br /> they are classified in a heading other than that of the product and that their value<br /> does not exceed 8 % of the ex-works price of the product.<br /> 6.2. Without  prejudice  to  Note 6.3,  materials,  which  are  not  classified  within<br /> Chapters 50 to 63, may be used freely in the manufacture of textile products,<br /> whether or not they contain textiles.<br /> Example:<br /> If a rule in the list provides that, for a particular textile item (such as trousers),<br /> yarn must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons,<br /> because buttons are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63. For the same reason,<br /> it does not prevent the use of slide-fasteners, even though slide-fasteners normally<br /> contain textiles.<br /> 6.3. Where a percentage-rule applies, the value of materials which are not classified<br /> within Chapters 50 to 63 must be taken into account when calculating the value of<br /> the non-originating materials incorporated.<br /> Note 7:<br /> 7.1. For the purposes of headings ex 2707, 2713 to<br /> ex 3403, the \"specific processes\" are the following:<br /> (a)  vacuum-distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation-process;<br /> (c)  cracking;<br /> (d) reforming;<br /> (e)  extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f)  the process comprising all of the following operations: processing with<br /> concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation<br /> with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification with naturally-active<br /> earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;<br /> (g) polymerisation;<br /> (h) alkylation;<br /> (i)   isomerisation.<br /> 7.2.

The further treatment,<br /> with hydrogen, of lubricating oils of heading ex 2710 (e.g. hydrofinishing or<br /> decolourisation), in order, more especially, to improve colour or stability<br /> shall not, however, be deemed to be a specific process;<br /> (n) in respect of fuel oils of heading ex 2710 only, atmospheric distillation, on<br /> condition that less than 30 % of these products distils, by volume, including<br /> losses, at 300 \u00b0C, by the ASTM D 86 method;<br /> (o) in respect of heavy oils other than gas oils and fuel oils of heading ex 2710<br /> only, treatment by means of a high-frequency electrical brush-discharge;<br /> (p) in respect of crude products (other than petroleum jelly, ozokerite, lignite wax<br /> or peat wax, paraffin wax containing by weight less than 0.75 % of oil) of<br /> heading ex 2712 only, de-oiling by fractional crystallisation.<br /> 7.3.

<br> (b) operations or processes to facilitate shipment or transportation; or <br> (c) operations or processes relating to packaging or presentation of the <br> goods for their respective sale. <br> 2 Operations or processes under paragraph 1 shall include, inter alia: <br> (a) airing, ventilation, drying, refrigeration, freezing;

<br> (b) if the ruling is not in accordance with an interpretation agreed by the <br> Parties regarding Chapter 3 or Chapter 4; <br> (c) if there is a change in the material facts or circumstances on which the ruling is based; <br> (d) to conform with a modification of Chapter 3, Chapter 4, this Chapter or <br> the Uniform Regulations; or <br> (e) to conform with a judicial or administrative decision or a change in its domestic law. <br> 7 Each Party shall provide that any modification or revocation of an <br> advanced ruling is effective on the date on which the modification or revocation <br> (a) the observers do not participate in a manner other than as observers;

<br> (b) the exporter's or producer's operations are consistent with the material facts <br> and circumstances on which the advanced ruling is based; and <br> (c) the supporting data and computations used in applying the basis or method <br> (e) the names and titles of the officials performing the verification visit; and <br> for calculating value or allocating cost were correct in all material respects. <br> 10 Each Party shall provide that where its competent authority determines that <br> any requirement in paragraph 9 has not been satisfied, it may modify or revoke <br> the advanced ruling as the circumstances may warrant. <br> 11 Each Party shall provide that, where the person to whom an advanced <br> ruling was issued demonstrates that it used reasonable care and acted in good <br> faith in presenting the facts and circumstances on which the ruling was based, <br> and where the competent authority of a Party determines that the ruling was <br> based on incorrect information, the person to whom the ruling was issued shall <br> not be subject to penalties. <br> 12 Each Party shall provide that where it issues an advanced ruling to a <br> person that has misrepresented or omitted material facts or circumstances on <br> which such a ruling is based or has failed to act in accordance with the terms <br> and conditions of the ruling, the Party may apply such measures as the <br> circumstances may warrant. <br> 13 The Parties shall provide that the person to whom the advanced ruling was <br> issued may use it only while the material facts or circumstances that were the <br> basis of its issuance are still present. In this case, the person to whom the <br> advanced ruling was issued may present the necessary information for the issuing <br> authority to proceed pursuant to paragraph 6. <br> 14 A good that is subject to an origin verification process or any instance of <br> review or appeal in the territory of one of the Parties may not undergo an advanced ruling. <br> 1 Each Party shall grant substantially the same rights of review and appeal <br> of determinations of origin and advanced rulings by its customs administration, <br> as it provides to importers in its territory, to any person: <br> (a) who completes and signs a Certificate of Origin for a good that has <br> been the subject of a determination of origin pursuant to Article 5.8.12; or <br> (b) who has received an advanced ruling pursuant to Article 5.9. <br> (a) at least one level of administrative review independent of the <br> official or office responsible for the determination under review; and <br> (b) in accordance with its domestic law, judicial or quasi-judicial review of the <br> determination or decision taken at the final level of administrative review. <br> Article 5.11: Penalties <br> 1 Each Party shall maintain measures imposing criminal, civil or <br> administrative responsibilities for violations of its laws and regulations relating to this Chapter. <br> 2 Nothing in Articles 5.3.1(d), 5.3.2, 5.4.2, 5.8.4, 5.8.7 or 5.8.9 shall be <br> construed to prevent a Party from applying such measures as the circumstances may warrant. <br> "}]}]}, "members_found": ["152", "410", 2, 8703900000]}

The first two sections of the list contain description of the obtained product. The first<br /> section specifies the number of the product group or product code used under the<br /> Harmonized system, whereas the second section contains description of goods that is<br /> used in this system for a relevant product group or product code. For each paragraph of<br /> the first two sections in section 3 or 4 a rule is provided. If in certain instances in<br /> paragraphs in the first section \"ex\" is used, it means that the rules contained in sections 3<br /> or 4 shall apply only to a part of the relevant product group specified in section 2.<br /> 2.2. If in section 1 several numbers of product groups are provided, or if in section 2 there<br /> is a number of the product group, and the description of the goods in section 2 is general,<br /> then the relevant rule in section 3 or 4 shall apply to all products which in accordance<br /> with the Harmonized System are classified in the codes of this group or in any of the<br /> codes specified in section 1.<br /> 2.3. If in the list there are several rules that shall apply to different products within one<br /> product group, then every paragraph contains description of the part of the product group<br /> to which relevant rules of sections 3 or 4 apply.<br /> 2.4. If for the paragraphs of the first two sections a rule is provided in section 3 and in<br /> section 4, the exporter may choose as an alternative one of these rules - either a rule<br /> provided in section 3, or a rule provided in section 4. If in section 4 there is no rule<br /> concerning origin, then the rule provided in section 3 shall apply.<br /> Note 3:<br /> 3.1. Provisions of Article 5 of the Protocol which concern products that have acquired a<br /> status of originating in a country and are used for production of other products, shall<br /> apply whether or not this status was acquired within the limits of a factory where these<br /> products are used, or at the other factory in the Parties.<br /> Example:<br /> An engine under product code N 8407, for which a rule provides that value of materials<br /> originating in the third countries that may be included in this engine should not exceed 40<br /> % of the EXW price, and is produced from \"other alloy steel by forging\" of the product<br /> code N 7224.<br /> If such forging was performed in the Party from ingots originating in the third countries,<br /> it thus had obtained the status of origin under the rule for the product code N 7224 from<br /> the list. This processing may later be considered originating for purposes of<br /> determination of the cost of the engines, whether or not this processing was carried out at<br /> the same or another factory of a Party. Therefore, the value of ingots originating in the<br /> third countries shall not be taken into consideration at the time of adding value of used<br /> materials originating in the third countries.<br /> 3.2. A rule from the list sets a minimum level of required transformation or processing,<br /> and performing transformation or processing in excess of these requirements also grants a<br /> status of origin in a Party; and on the contrary, performing the transformation or<br /> processing at a lower level may not grant the status of origin in a Party. Therefore, if a<br /> rule provides that at the certain level of production there may be used a material<br /> originating in the third countries, the use of such a material shall be allowed at an earlier<br /> stage of production and shall not be allowed at a later stage.<br /> 3.3. Without prejudice to provisions of the note 3.2, if a rule provides that it is allowed to<br /> use \"materials of any product code\", then it is allowed to use also materials that are under<br /> the same product code, except for specific limitations that also may be specified in this<br /> rule. However, the language \"production from materials of any product code, including<br /> other materials under product code #...\" means that there may be used only materials<br /> classified in the same product group as the product that have description that differs from<br /> the description of the product, presented in section 2 of the list.<br /> 3.4. If a rule from the list provides that the product may be produced from more than one<br /> material, it does not mean that any or all materials may be used. Using all materials is not<br /> required.<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for fabrics HS 5208 - 5212 provides that one may use natural fabrics, and also,<br /> among other materials, - chemical materials. It does not mean that both types of materials<br /> must be used; one can use either material or both materials.<br /> 3.5. If a rule from the list provides that the product must be produced from the specific<br /> material, this condition, obviously, does not prohibit the use of other materials which due<br /> to their internal nature do not conform to this rule (see also note 6.2 below concerning<br /> textile materials).<br /> Example:<br /> The rule concerning finished food products of product category N 1904, which separately<br /> provides for use of cereals and derivatives, does not prohibit use of mineral salts,<br /> chemical substances and other additions which are not cereal products.<br /> However, this rule shall not apply to the products, which, although could not be produced<br /> from a specific material specified in the list, may have been produced from the material<br /> of the same type at the earlier stage of production.<br /> Example:<br /> In the event of clothes articles of group 62, made from nonwoven materials, if for this<br /> type of clothes only use of yarn originating from the third countries is permitted, one may<br /> not begin with the use of nonwoven clothes, even if nonwoven clothes usually can not be<br /> produced from yarn. In such instances the initial material is usually the material that is<br /> used at the stage prior to yarn that is at the stage of yarn making.<br /> 3.6. If a rule from the list sets forth two percentage indicators concerning maximum value<br /> of the used materials originating in the third countries, these indicators may not be added<br /> up. In other words, the maximum value of all used materials originating in the third<br /> countries, may not at any moment exceed the greater of the two specified percentage<br /> indicators. Moreover - one may not exceed specific percentage indicators concerning<br /> specific materials to which they shall apply.<br /> Note 4:<br /> 4.1. The term \"natural fibers\" is used in the list for other fibers except man-made or<br /> synthetic fibers. The term is limited to stages that precede spinning, including residue,<br /> and includes, if otherwise is not specified, fibers that were combed or otherwise<br /> processed, but not spun.<br /> 4.2. Terms \"natural fibers\" includes horse hair under product code N 0503, silk under<br /> product codes N 5002 and 5003, as well as wool hair, fine or coarse animal hair under<br /> product codes N 5101 - 5105, cotton fibers under product codes N 5201 - 5203 and other<br /> vegetable textile fibers classified under product codes N 5301 - 5305.<br /> 4.3. Terms \"textile pulp\", \"chemical materials\" and \"paper materials\" are used in the list<br /> to reflect materials that are classified under groups 50 - 63 and may be used for<br /> production of man-made, synthetic or paper fibers or yarn.<br /> 4.4. Term \"man-made staple fibers\" is used in the list to reflect the use of synthetic or<br /> man-made wisp, staple fibers or yarn waste under product codes N 5501 - 5507.<br /> Note 5:<br /> 5.1. If for a particular product in the list there is a reference to this note, then conditions<br /> specified in section 3 shall not apply to any basic textile materials which are used in<br /> production of this product, which all taken together provide for no more than 10 percent<br /> of the total weight of all used basic textile materials (see also notes 5.3 and 5.4 below).<br /> 5.2. However, the tolerance margin specified in note 5.1 shall apply only to complex<br /> products produced from two or more basic textile materials.<br /> The materials specified below are basic textile materials:<br /> - silk;<br /> - wool;<br /> - coarse animal hair;<br /> - fine animal hair;<br /> - cotton;<br /> - paper materials and paper;<br /> - flux;<br /> - yarn;<br /> - jute and other textile bast fibers;<br /> - sisal and other textile fibers of the genus Agave;<br /> - coconut, abaca (Manila hemp or Musa textilis Nee), ramie and other vegetable textile<br /> fibers;<br /> - synthetic man-made thread;<br /> - man-made thread;<br /> - synthetic and man-made staple fibers made of polypropylene;<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibers of polyester;<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibers of polyamide;<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibers of polyacrylnitrite;<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibers of polyamide;<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibers of polytetraphluroethylen;<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibers of polyphenylensulphide;<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibers of polyvinylchloride;<br /> - other synthetic man-made staple fibers;<br /> - man-made staple fibers of viscose;<br /> - other man-made staple fibers;<br /> - yarn of polyurethane, with segments of polyester filaments, with or without braided<br /> yarn;<br /> - yarn of polyurethane, with segments of polyester filaments, with or without braided<br /> yarn;<br /> - products under product code N 5605 - Metallised yarn, including a strip with aluminum<br /> cord or a plastic strip, covered with aluminum powder or without such powder, with<br /> width not exceeding 5 mm, with layers of transparent or colored adhesive between the<br /> two layers of plastic strip;<br /> - other products under product code N 5605.<br /> Example:<br /> The yarn under product code N 5205 made of cotton fibers under product code N 5203<br /> and synthetic staple fibers under product code N 5506, is the composite yarn.<br /> Therefore, synthetic staple fibers originating in the third countries and not meeting the<br /> rules concerning origin (which provide for production from chemical materials or textile<br /> pulp), may be used within the limit of 10 percent of the weight of the yarn.<br /> Example:<br /> Wool fibers under product code N 5112, made from woolen yarn under product code N<br /> 5107 and synthetic yarn with staple fibers under product code N 5509, is the composite<br /> fabric. Therefore there may be used the synthetic yarn that is not meeting requirements<br /> concerning origin (which provide for production from chemical materials or textile pulp),<br /> or the wool yarn that is not meeting requirements concerning origin (providing for<br /> production from natural fibers, not combed and not otherwise prepared for spinning), or a<br /> combination of these two types on condition that their total weight does not exceed 10<br /> percent of the weight of the fabric.<br /> Example:<br /> Terry textile fabrics under product code N 5802, produced from cotton yarn under<br /> product code N 5205 and cotton fabric under product code N 5210, are composite<br /> products only in the case where own cotton fabric is the composite fabric that is produced<br /> from the yarn classified under two different product groups, or if the used cotton fabrics<br /> are composite.<br /> Example:<br /> If a pile textile fabric in question was produced from cotton yarn under product code N<br /> 5205 and synthetic fabrics under product code N 5407, then, obviously, two different<br /> types of basic textile materials were used, and the terry textile fabric, consequently, is a<br /> composite product.<br /> Example:<br /> A pile carpet produced either from man-made yarn or from jute-based cotton yarn, is a<br /> composite product, because three basic textile materials were used for its production.<br /> Therefore any materials originating in the third countries, may be used at the later stages<br /> of production, then specified in the rule, on condition that their total weight does not<br /> exceed 10 percent of the weight of textile materials of the carpet. Therefore both the jute<br /> basis and / or man-made yarn at this stage of production can be used on condition that<br /> requirements concerning weight are observed.<br /> 5.3. In the case of products that include \u00abyarn of polyurethane, with segments of<br /> polyester filaments, with or without braided yarn\", the tolerance margin for such yarn<br /> shall be 20 percent.<br /> 5.4. In the case of products that include \"a strip with aluminum cord or a plastic strip,<br /> covered with aluminum powder or without such powder, with width not exceeding 5 mm,<br /> with layers of transparent or colored adhesive between the two layers of plastic strip\",<br /> this tolerance margin will be 30 percent for such a strip.<br /> Note 6:<br /> 6.1. In the case of textile products footnoted in the list with a reference to this note, textile<br /> materials can be used, except stiffened fabrics and additional stiffened fabrics used as<br /> foundation that do not meet requirements specified in the list in section 3 for respective<br /> finished product, on condition that they classified under product group other than the<br /> product in question, and that their value does not exceed 8 percent of the price of the<br /> product on the EXW basis.<br /> 6.2. Without prejudice to provisions of the note 6.3, materials which are not classified<br /> under product groups 50 - 63, may be used in production of textile products, whether or<br /> not they contain textile materials.<br /> Example:<br /> If a rule from the list provides that for a particular textile product group, such as trousers,<br /> yarn must be used, it does not mean that the use of metal articles, such as buttons, is not<br /> allowed because buttons are not classified under groups 50 - 63. For the same reason it<br /> does not prohibit the use of zippers, although zippers usually include textile materials.<br /> 6.3. In the event of application of a percentage rule, one should take into account value of<br /> materials that are not classified under groups 50 - 63, for purposes of determination of the<br /> value of the materials originating in the third countries, which are included in the product.<br /> Note 7:<br /> 7.1. For purposes of product codes ex 2707, 2713 - 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex 3403<br /> the term \"special processes\" includes:<br /> a) vacuum distillation;<br /> b) repeat rectification;<br /> c) cracking;<br /> d) reforming;<br /> e) extraction with solvents;<br /> f) process that involves all following operations: treatment by concentrated sulfuric acid,<br /> oleum or sulfur anhydrite; alkaline neutralization; decoloring using natural active soil,<br /> activated soil, carbon absorber or bauxite;<br /> g) polymerization;<br /> h) alkalization;<br /> i) isomerization.<br /> 7.2. For purposes of product codes N 2710, 2711 and 2712 the terms \"special processes\"<br /> includes:<br /> a) vacuum distillation;<br /> b) repeat rectification;<br /> c) cracking;<br /> d) reforming;<br /> e) solvent extraction;<br /> f) process that involves all following operations: treatment by concentrated sulfuric acid,<br /> oleum or sulfur anhydrite; alkaline neutralization; decoloring using natural active soil,<br /> activated soil, carbon absorber or bauxite;<br /> g) polymerization;<br /> h) alkalization;<br /> i) isomerization;<br /> j) concerning heavy oil products that belong only to the product code N ex 2710, - de-<br /> sulfuring by hydrogen that results in the sulfur content in the treated products that is<br /> reduced by approximately 85 percent (ASTM 1266-59 T method);<br /> k) concerning products that belong only to product code N 2710, - other paraffin -<br /> removing treatment, except filtration;<br /> l) concerning heavy oil products that belong only to product code N ex 2710, - treatment<br /> by hydrogen under pressure of 20 bar and temperature over 250 C using catalysts, except<br /> for de-sulfuring, if hydrogen is an active element of the chemical reaction. Further<br /> treatment of oils under product code N ex 2710 with hydrogen (for instance, hydrogen<br /> processing or decoloring) to mostly improve quality of color or stability, shall not be<br /> considered special process;<br /> m) concerning oil products that belong only to product code N ex 2710 - atmospheric<br /> sublimation on condition that less than 30 percent of these products by volume, including<br /> waste, is sublimated under the temperature of 300 C using the method ASTM D 86;<br /> n) concerning heavy oil products except gas oils and oil fuels that are classified only<br /> under product code N ex 2710, - treatment by means of high-frequency electric<br /> discharge.<br /> 7.3.

The <br> importing Party shall not consider the failure or refusal of the importer to obtain and <br> supply that information as a failure of the exporter or producer to supply the information <br> or as a ground for denying preferential tariff treatment. <br> 3 Each Party shall allow an exporter or producer who receives a verification letter <br> under paragraph 1(a) or a questionnaire under paragraph 1(b) no less than 30 days from <br> the date of receipt of that letter or questionnaire to provide the information and <br> documentation required or the completed questionnaire. On written request by the <br> exporter or producer made during that period, the importing Party may grant the exporter <br> or producer a single extension of the deadline for a period of no more than 30 days. <br> 4 If an exporter or producer fails to provide the information and documentation <br> required by a verification letter or fails to return a duly completed questionnaire within <br> the period or extension set out in paragraph 3, the importing Party may deny preferential <br> (a) the observers do not participate in a manner other than as observers;

and <br> (b) obtain the written consent of the exporter or producer whose premises are to be visited. <br> 6 The notification referred to in paragraph 5 must include: <br> (d) the object and scope of the proposed verification visit, including <br> specific reference to the good that is the subject of the verification; <br> (e) the names and titles of the officials performing the verification visit; and <br> 7 If an exporter or producer has not given its written consent to a proposed <br> verification visit within 30 days of receipt of a notification under paragraph 5, the <br> notifying Party may deny preferential tariff treatment to the good that would have been <br> the subject of the visit. <br> 8 The Party whose customs administration receives notification under <br> paragraph 5(a)(ii), within 15 days of receipt of the notification, may postpone in writing <br> to the customs administration who sent the notice, the proposed verification visit for no <br> more than 60 days from the date of that receipt or for a longer period that the <br> Parties may decide. <br> 9 Each Party shall allow, when the exporter or producer receives notification under <br> paragraph 5(a)(i), the exporter or producer to, on a single occasion, within 15 days of <br> receipt of the notification, request in writing the postponement of the proposed <br> verification visit for no more than 60 days from the date of that receipt or for a longer <br> period as accepted by the notifying Party. <br> 10 A Party shall not deny preferential tariff treatment to a good based only on the <br> postponement of a verification visit under paragraphs 8 or 9. <br> 11 A Party shall permit an exporter or a producer whose good is the subject of a <br> verification visit by the other Party to designate two observers to be present <br> during the visit, provided that: <br> (b) the failure of the exporter or producer to designate observers does not <br> 12 When a Party conducts a verification of origin involving a value test, de minimis <br> calculation or any other provision in Chapter Three (Rules of Origin) to which Generally <br> Accepted Accounting Principles may be relevant, it shall apply those principles as they <br> apply in the territory of the other Party from which the good was exported. <br> 13 When the producer of a good calculates the net cost of the good as set out <br> in Article 3.04 (Rules of Origin - Value Test), the importing Party will not verify, during <br> the period over which the net cost is being calculated, whether the good <br> satisfies the value test. <br> 14 The Party conducting a verification shall provide the exporter or producer whose <br> good is the subject of the verification with a written determination of whether the good <br> qualifies as originating, including findings of fact and the legal basis for the determination. <br> 15 If a Party determines as a result of an origin verification that the good that is the <br> subject of the verification does not qualify as originating, the Party shall include in its <br> written determination under paragraph 14 a written notice of intent to deny preferential <br> tariff treatment of the good. <br> 16 Each Party shall ensure that a written notice of intent to deny preferential tariff <br> treatment under paragraph 15 provides for at least 30 days during which the exporter or <br> producer of the good may provide, with regard to that determination, written comments <br> or additional information that will be taken into account by the Party prior <br> to completing the verification. <br> 17 In accordance with each Party's laws and regulations, if verifications by a Party <br> indicate a pattern of conduct by an exporter or a producer of false or unsupported <br> representations that a good imported into its territory qualifies as originating, the Party <br> may withhold preferential tariff treatment to identical goods exported or produced by that <br> exporter or producer until that exporter or producer establishes compliance with <br> Chapter Three (Rules of Origin). <br> 18 If, in conducting a verification of origin of a good imported into its territory under <br> this Article, a Party conducts a verification of the origin of a material that is used in the <br> production of the good, the Party shall conduct the verification of origin of the material in <br> accordance with the procedures in paragraphs 1 through 3, 5, 6, 8, 9 through 13 and 20. <br> 19 When a Party conducts a verification under paragraph 18, the Party may consider <br> the material to be non-originating in determining whether the good is an originating good <br> if the producer or supplier of that material does not allow the Party access to information <br> required to make a determination of whether the material is an originating material by the <br> following or other means: <br> (a) denial of access to its records; <br> (b) failure to respond to a verification questionnaire or letter; or <br> (c) refusal to consent, within 30 days of receipt of a notification under <br> paragraph 5, to a verification visit. <br> 20 For purposes of this Article, the importing Party shall ensure that communication <br> to the exporter or producer and to the other Party are sent by means that can produce a <br> confirmation of receipt.

and <br> (b) an importer claiming preferential tariff treatment for a good imported into <br> the Party's territory must maintain, in that territory documentation relating <br> to the importation of the good, including a copy of the Certificate of <br> Origin, for 5 years after the date of importation of the good or for a longer <br> period as specified by the Party. <br> 2 When a Party requires importers, exporters or producers in its territory to <br> maintain documentation or records in relation to the origin of the good, in accordance <br> with that Party's laws and regulations, it shall permit them to do so in any medium, <br> provided that the documentation or records can be retrieved and printed. <br> 3 A Party may deny preferential tariff treatment to a good that is the subject of an <br> origin verification where the exporter, producer or importer of the good that is required to <br> maintain records or documentation under this Article: <br> (a) fails to maintain records or documentation relevant to determining the <br> origin of the good in accordance with the requirements of the Chapter; or <br> (b) denies access to the records or documentation. <br> (f) the legal authority for the verification visit. <br> Article 4.07: Origin Verifications <br> 1 For purposes of determining whether a good imported into its territory from the <br> territory of the other Party qualifies as an originating good, a Party may, through its <br> customs administration, conduct a verification only by means of: <br> (a) verification letters requesting information from the exporter or producer of <br> the good in the territory of the other Party; <br> (b) written questionnaires to an exporter or a producer in the territory of the other Party; <br> (c) visits to the premises of an exporter or a producer in the territory of the <br> other Party to review the records referred to in Article 4.06(1)(a) and <br> observe facilities used in the production of the good; or <br> (d) any other method that the Parties decide. <br> 2 For purposes of verifying the origin of a good, the importing Party may request <br> the importer of the good to voluntarily obtain and supply written information voluntarily <br> provided by the exporter or producer of the good in the territory of the other Party. The <br> importing Party shall not consider the failure or refusal of the importer to obtain and <br> supply that information as a failure of the exporter or producer to supply the information <br> or as a ground for denying preferential tariff treatment. <br> 3 Each Party shall allow an exporter or producer who receives a verification letter <br> under paragraph 1(a) or a questionnaire under paragraph 1(b) no less than 30 days from <br> the date of receipt of that letter or questionnaire to provide the information and <br> documentation required or the completed questionnaire. On written request by the <br> exporter or producer made during that period, the importing Party may grant the exporter <br> or producer a single extension of the deadline for a period of no more than 30 days. <br> 4 If an exporter or producer fails to provide the information and documentation <br> required by a verification letter or fails to return a duly completed questionnaire within <br> the period or extension set out in paragraph 3, the importing Party may deny preferential <br> (a) the observers do not participate in a manner other than as observers; and <br> tariff treatment to the good in question in accordance with the procedures set out in <br> paragraphs 14, 15 and 16. <br> 5 Prior to conducting a verification visit under paragraph 1(c), a Party, through its <br> customs administration, shall: <br> (a) deliver a written notification of its intention to conduct the visit: <br> (i) to the exporter or producer whose premises are to be visited, <br> (ii) to the customs administration of the other Party, and <br> (iii) if requested by the other Party, to the embassy of that Party in the <br> territory of the Party proposing to conduct the visit; and <br> (b) obtain the written consent of the exporter or producer whose premises are to be visited. <br> 6 The notification referred to in paragraph 5 must include: <br> (d) the object and scope of the proposed verification visit, including <br> specific reference to the good that is the subject of the verification; <br> (e) the names and titles of the officials performing the verification visit; and <br> 7 If an exporter or producer has not given its written consent to a proposed <br> verification visit within 30 days of receipt of a notification under paragraph 5, the <br> notifying Party may deny preferential tariff treatment to the good that would have been <br> the subject of the visit. <br> 8 The Party whose customs administration receives notification under <br> paragraph 5(a)(ii), within 15 days of receipt of the notification, may postpone in writing <br> to the customs administration who sent the notice, the proposed verification visit for no <br> more than 60 days from the date of that receipt or for a longer period that the <br> Parties may decide. <br> 9 Each Party shall allow, when the exporter or producer receives notification under <br> paragraph 5(a)(i), the exporter or producer to, on a single occasion, within 15 days of <br> receipt of the notification, request in writing the postponement of the proposed <br> verification visit for no more than 60 days from the date of that receipt or for a longer <br> period as accepted by the notifying Party. <br> 10 A Party shall not deny preferential tariff treatment to a good based only on the <br> postponement of a verification visit under paragraphs 8 or 9. <br> 11 A Party shall permit an exporter or a producer whose good is the subject of a <br> verification visit by the other Party to designate two observers to be present <br> during the visit, provided that: <br> (b) the failure of the exporter or producer to designate observers does not <br> 12 When a Party conducts a verification of origin involving a value test, de minimis <br> calculation or any other provision in Chapter Three (Rules of Origin) to which Generally <br> Accepted Accounting Principles may be relevant, it shall apply those principles as they <br> apply in the territory of the other Party from which the good was exported. <br> 13 When the producer of a good calculates the net cost of the good as set out <br> in Article 3.04 (Rules of Origin - Value Test), the importing Party will not verify, during <br> the period over which the net cost is being calculated, whether the good <br> satisfies the value test. <br> 14 The Party conducting a verification shall provide the exporter or producer whose <br> good is the subject of the verification with a written determination of whether the good <br> qualifies as originating, including findings of fact and the legal basis for the determination. <br> 15 If a Party determines as a result of an origin verification that the good that is the <br> subject of the verification does not qualify as originating, the Party shall include in its <br> written determination under paragraph 14 a written notice of intent to deny preferential <br> tariff treatment of the good. <br> 16 Each Party shall ensure that a written notice of intent to deny preferential tariff <br> treatment under paragraph 15 provides for at least 30 days during which the exporter or <br> producer of the good may provide, with regard to that determination, written comments <br> or additional information that will be taken into account by the Party prior <br> to completing the verification. <br> 17 In accordance with each Party's laws and regulations, if verifications by a Party <br> indicate a pattern of conduct by an exporter or a producer of false or unsupported <br> representations that a good imported into its territory qualifies as originating, the Party <br> may withhold preferential tariff treatment to identical goods exported or produced by that <br> exporter or producer until that exporter or producer establishes compliance with <br> Chapter Three (Rules of Origin). <br> 18 If, in conducting a verification of origin of a good imported into its territory under <br> this Article, a Party conducts a verification of the origin of a material that is used in the <br> production of the good, the Party shall conduct the verification of origin of the material in <br> accordance with the procedures in paragraphs 1 through 3, 5, 6, 8, 9 through 13 and 20. <br> 19 When a Party conducts a verification under paragraph 18, the Party may consider <br> the material to be non-originating in determining whether the good is an originating good <br> if the producer or supplier of that material does not allow the Party access to information <br> required to make a determination of whether the material is an originating material by the <br> following or other means: <br> (a) denial of access to its records; <br> (b) failure to respond to a verification questionnaire or letter; or <br> (c) refusal to consent, within 30 days of receipt of a notification under <br> paragraph 5, to a verification visit. <br> 20 For purposes of this Article, the importing Party shall ensure that communication <br> to the exporter or producer and to the other Party are sent by means that can produce a <br> confirmation of receipt. The periods referred to in this Article begin from the <br> date of that receipt. <br> "}]}]}, "members_found": ["124", "591", 4, 8703900000]}

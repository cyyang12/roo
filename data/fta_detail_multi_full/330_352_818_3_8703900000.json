The first column<br /> gives the heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonized System<br /> and the second column gives the description of goods used in that system for<br /> that heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns a rule is<br /> specified in columns 3 or 4. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column<br /> is preceded by an 'ex', this signifies that the rules in columns 3 or 4 apply only to<br /> the part of that heading as described in column 2.<br /> 2.2 Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter<br /> number is given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in<br /> general terms, the adjacent rules in columns 3 or 4 apply to all products which,<br /> under the Harmonized System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in any<br /> of the headings grouped together in column 1.<br /> 2.3 Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a<br /> heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered<br /> by the adjacent rules in columns 3 or 4.<br /> 2.4 Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns<br /> 3 and 4, the exporter may opt, as an alternative, to apply either the rule set out in<br /> column 3 or that set out in column 4. If no origin rule is given in column 4, the<br /> rule set out in column 3 has to be applied.<br /> Note 3:<br /> 3.1 The provisions of Article 6 of the Protocol concerning products having acquired<br /> originating status which are used in the manufacture of other products apply<br /> regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where these<br /> products are used or in another factory in a Party.<br /> Example:<br /> An engine of heading 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-<br /> originating materials which may be incorporated may not exceed 40 per cent of<br /> the ex-works price, is made from \"other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging\"<br /> of heading ex 7224.<br /> If this forging has been forged in the Party concerned from a non-originating<br /> ingot, it has already acquired originating status by virtue of the rule for heading<br /> ex 7224 in the list. The forging can then count as originating in the value<br /> calculation for the engine regardless of whether it was produced in the same<br /> factory or in another factory in the Party concerned. The value of the non-<br /> originating ingot is thus not taken into account when adding up the value of the<br /> non-originating materials used.<br /> 3.2 The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing<br /> required and the carrying out of more working or processing also confers<br /> originating status; conversely, the carrying out of less working or processing<br /> cannot confer originating status. Thus if a rule provides that non-originating<br /> material at a certain level of manufacture may be used, the use of such material<br /> at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed and the use of such material at a<br /> later stage is not.<br /> 3.3 Without prejudice to Note 3.2 where a rule states that \"materials of any heading\"<br /> may be used, materials of the same heading as the product may also be used,<br /> subject, however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in the<br /> rule. However, the expression \"manufacture from materials of any heading,<br /> including other materials of heading ...\" means that only materials classified in<br /> the same heading as the product of a different description than that of the<br /> product as given in column 2 of the list may be used.<br /> 3.4 When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more<br /> than one material, this means that any one or more materials may be used. It<br /> does not require that all be used.<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for fabrics of heading 5208 to 5212 provides that natural fibres may be<br /> used and that chemical materials, among other materials, may also be used. This<br /> does not mean that both have to be used; it is possible to use one or the other or<br /> both.<br /> 3.5 Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a<br /> particular material, the condition obviously does not prevent the use of other<br /> materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule. (See<br /> also Note 6.2 below in relation to textiles).<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for prepared foods of heading 1904 which specifically excludes the use<br /> of cereals and their derivatives does not prevent the use of mineral salts,<br /> chemicals and other additives which are not products from cereals.<br /> However, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be<br /> manufactured from the particular material specified in the list, can be produced<br /> from a material of the same nature at an earlier stage of manufacture.<br /> Example:<br /> In the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 made from non-woven<br /> materials, if the use of only non-originating yarn is allowed for this class of<br /> article, it is not possible to start from non-woven cloth - even if non-woven<br /> cloths cannot normally be made from yarn. In such cases, the starting material<br /> would normally be at the stage before yarn - that is the fibre stage.<br /> 3.6 Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of<br /> non-originating materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be<br /> added together. In other words, the maximum value of all the non-originating<br /> materials used may never exceed the highest of the percentages given.<br /> Furthermore, the individual percentages must not be exceeded in relation to the<br /> particular materials they apply to.<br /> Note 4:<br /> 4.1 The term \"natural fibres\" is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial<br /> or synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place,<br /> including waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres that have been<br /> carded, combed or otherwise processed but not spun.<br /> 4.2 The term \"natural fibres\" includes horsehair of heading 0503, silk of heading<br /> 5002 and 5003 as well as the wool fibres, fine or coarse animal hair of heading<br /> 5101 to 5105, the cotton fibres of heading 5201 to 5203 and the other vegetable<br /> fibres of heading 5301 to 5305.<br /> 4.3 The terms \"textile pulp\", \"chemical materials\" and \"paper-making materials\" are<br /> used in the list to describe the materials not classified in Chapters 50 to 63,<br /> which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.<br /> 4.4 The term \"man-made staple fibres\" is used in the list to refer to synthetic or<br /> artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of heading 5501 to 5507.<br /> Note 5:<br /> 5.1 Where for a given product in the list a reference is made to this note, the<br /> conditions set out in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials,<br /> used in the manufacture of this product, which, taken together, represent 10 per<br /> cent or less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also<br /> Notes 5.3 and 5.4 below).<br /> 5.2 However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 5.1 may only be applied to mixed<br /> products which have been made from two or more basic textile materials.<br /> The following are the basic textile materials:<br /> - silk,<br /> - wool,<br /> - coarse animal hair,<br /> - fine animal hair,<br /> - horsehair,<br /> - cotton,<br /> - paper-making materials and paper,<br /> - flax,<br /> - true hemp,<br /> - jute and other textile bast fibres,<br /> - sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave,<br /> - coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,<br /> - synthetic man-made filaments,<br /> - artificial man-made filaments,<br /> - current conducting filaments,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyphenylene sulphide,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyvinyl chloride,<br /> - other synthetic man-made staple fibres,<br /> - artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose,<br /> - other artificial man-made staple fibres,<br /> - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether<br /> whether or not gimped,<br /> - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester<br /> whether or not gimped,<br /> - products of heading 5605 (metallized yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a<br /> core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with<br /> aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a<br /> transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film,<br /> - other products of heading 5605.<br /> Example:<br /> A yarn of heading 5205 made from cotton fibres of heading 5203 and synthetic<br /> staple fibres of heading 5506 is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating<br /> synthetic staple fibres that do not satisfy the origin rules (which require<br /> manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) may be used up to a weight<br /> of 10 per cent of the yarn.<br /> Example:<br /> A woollen fabric of heading 5112 made from woollen yarn of heading 5107 and<br /> synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading 5509 is a mixed fabric. Therefore<br /> synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture<br /> from chemical materials or textile pulp) or woollen yarn that does not satisfy the<br /> origin rules (which require manufacture from natural fibres, not carded or<br /> combed or otherwise prepared for spinning) or a combination of the two may be<br /> used provided their total weight does not exceed 10 per cent of the weight of the<br /> fabric.<br /> Example:<br /> Tufted textile fabric of heading 5802 made from cotton yarn of heading 5205<br /> and cotton fabric of heading 5210 is only a mixed product if the cotton fabric is<br /> itself a mixed fabric being made from yarns classified in two separate headings<br /> or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.<br /> Example:<br /> If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading<br /> 5205 and synthetic fabric of heading 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are<br /> two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is accordingly a<br /> mixed product.<br /> 5.3 In the case of products incorporating \"yarn made of polyurethane segmented<br /> with flexible segments of polyether whether or not gimped\" this tolerance is 20<br /> per cent in respect of this yarn.<br /> 5.4 In the case of products incorporating \"strip consisting of a core of aluminium<br /> foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of<br /> a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of an adhesive between two<br /> films of plastic film\", this tolerance is 30 per cent in respect of this strip.<br /> Note 6:<br /> 6.1 In the case of those textile products which are marked in the list by a footnote<br /> referring to this note, textile materials, with the exception of linings and<br /> interlinings, which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the<br /> made-up product concerned may be used provided that they are classified in a<br /> heading other than that of the product and that their value does not exceed 8 per<br /> cent of the ex-works price of the product.<br /> 6.2 Without prejudice to Note 6.3, materials which are not classified within<br /> Chapters 50 to 63 may be used freely in the manufacture of textile products,<br /> whether or not they contain textiles.<br /> Example:<br /> If a rule in the list provides that for a particular textile item, such as trousers,<br /> yarn must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons,<br /> because buttons are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63. For the same<br /> reason, it does not prevent the use of slide-fasteners even though slide-fasteners<br /> normally contain textiles.<br /> 6.3 Where a percentage rule applies, the value of materials which are not classified<br /> within Chapters 50 to 63 must be taken into account when calculating the value<br /> of the non-originating materials incorporated.<br /> Note 7<br /> 7.1 For the purposes of heading ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex<br /> 3403, the \"specific processes\" are the following:<br /> (a) vacuum distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;<br /> (c) cracking;<br /> (d) reforming;<br /> (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f) the process comprising all the following operations: processing with<br /> concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralization<br /> with alkaline agents; decolorization and purification with naturally active<br /> earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;<br /> (g) polymerization;<br /> (h) alkylation;<br /> (i) isomerization.<br /> 7.2 For the purposes of heading 2710, 2711 and 2712, the \"specific processes\" are<br /> the following:<br /> (a) vacuum distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;<br /> (c) cracking;<br /> (d) reforming;<br /> (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f) the process comprising all the following operations: processing with<br /> concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralization<br /> with alkaline agents; decolorization and purification with naturally active<br /> earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;<br /> (g) polymerization;<br /> (h) alkylation;<br /> (ij) isomerization;<br /> (k) in respect of heavy oils falling within heading ex 2710 only,<br /> desulphurization with hydrogen resulting in a reduction of at least 85 per<br /> cent of the sulphur content of the products processed (ASTM D 1266-59<br /> T method);<br /> (l) in respect of products falling within heading 2710 only, deparaffining by<br /> a process other than filtering;<br /> (m) in respect of heavy oils falling within heading ex 2710 only, treatment<br /> with hydrogen at a pressure of more than 20 bar and a temperature of<br /> more than 250\u00b0C with the use of a catalyst, other than to effect<br /> desulphurization, when the hydrogen constitutes an active element in a<br /> chemical reaction.

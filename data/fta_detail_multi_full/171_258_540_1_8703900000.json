There are four different types of rules, which vary according to the product:<br /> (a) through working or processing a maximum content of non-originating materials is not exceeded;<br /> (b) through working or processing the 4-digit Harmonised System heading or 6-digit Harmonised System sub-heading of<br /> the manufactured products becomes different from the 4-digit Harmonised System heading or 6-digit sub-heading<br /> respectively of the materials used;<br /> (c) a specific working and processing operation is carried out;<br /> (d) working or processing is carried out on certain wholly obtained materials.<br /> Note 2 \u2014 The structure of the list<br /> 2.1. Columns 1 and 2 describe the product obtained. Column 1 gives the chapter number, 4-digit heading or 6-digit sub-<br /> heading number used in the Harmonised System, as appropriate. Column 2 gives the description of goods used in<br /> that system for that heading or chapter. For each entry in columns 1 and 2, subject to Note 2.4, one or more rules<br /> (\u2018qualifying operations') are set out in column 3. These qualifying operations concern only non-originating materials.<br /> Where, in some cases, the entry in column 1 is preceded by \u2018ex', this signifies that the rule in column 3 applies only<br /> to the part of that heading as described in column 2.<br /> 2.2. Where several Harmonised System headings or sub-headings are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number<br /> is given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rule in column<br /> 3 applies to all products which, under the Harmonised System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in any of<br /> the headings or sub-headings grouped together in column 1.<br /> 2.3. Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each indent contains the<br /> description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rule in column 3.<br /> 2.4. Where two alternative rules are set out in column 3, separated by \u2018or', it is at the choice of the exporter which one<br /> to use.<br /> Note 3 \u2014 Examples of how to apply the rules<br /> 3.1. Article 4(2) of this Annex, concerning products having acquired originating status which are used in the manufacture<br /> of other products, shall apply, regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where these<br /> products are used or in another factory in the OCTs or in the Union.<br /> 3.2. Pursuant to Article 5 of this Annex, the working or processing carried out must go beyond the list of operations<br /> referred to in that Article. If it does not, the goods shall not qualify for the granting of the benefit of preferential<br /> tariff treatment, even if the conditions set out in the list below are met.<br /> Subject to the provision referred to in the first subparagraph, the rules in the list represent the minimum amount of<br /> working or processing required, and the carrying-out of more working or processing also confers originating status;<br /> conversely, the carrying-out of less working or processing cannot confer originating status. Thus, if a rule provides<br /> that non-originating material, at a certain level of manufacture, may be used, the use of such material at an earlier<br /> stage of manufacture is allowed, and the use of such material at a later stage is not.<br /> 3.3. Without prejudice to Note 3.2, where a rule uses the expression \u2018Manufacture from materials of any heading', then<br /> materials of any heading(s) (even materials of the same description and heading as the product) may be used, subject,<br /> however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in the rule.<br /> However, the expression \u2018Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of heading or<br /> \u2018Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of the same heading as the product' means<br /> that materials of any heading(s) may be used, except those of the same description as the product as given in<br /> column 2 of the list.<br /> L 344/60<br /> 19.12.2013<br /> 3.4. When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one material, this means that<br /> one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all be used.<br /> 3.5. Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular material, the rule does not<br /> prevent the use also of other materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy this condition.<br /> Note 4 \u2014 General provisions concerning certain agricultural goods<br /> 4.1. Agricultural goods falling within Chapters 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and heading 2401 which are grown or harvested in the<br /> territory of an OCTs shall be treated as originating in the territory of that country, even if grown from seeds, bulbs,<br /> rootstock, cuttings, grafts, shoots, buds, or other live parts of plants imported from another country.<br /> 4.2. In cases where the content of non-originating sugar in a given product is subject to limitations, the weight of sugars<br /> of headings 1701 (sucrose) and 1702 (e.g., fructose, glucose, lactose, maltose, isoglucose or invert sugar) used in the<br /> manufacture of the final product and used in the manufacture of the non-originating products incorporated in the<br /> final product is taken into account for the calculation of such limitations.<br /> Note 5 \u2014 Terminology used in respect of certain textile products<br /> 5.1. The term \u2018natural fibres' is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic fibres. It is restricted to<br /> the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres which have<br /> been carded, combed or otherwise processed, but not spun.<br /> 5.2. The term \u2018natural fibres' includes horsehair of heading 0503, silk of headings 5002 and 5003, as well as wool-fibres<br /> and fine or coarse animal hair of headings 5101 to 5105, cotton fibres of headings 5201 to 5203, and other<br /> vegetable fibres of headings 5301 to 5305.<br /> 5.3. The terms \u2018textile pulp', \u2018chemical materials' and \u2018paper-making materials' are used in the list to describe the materials,<br /> not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.<br /> 5.4. The term \u2018man-made staple fibres' is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament tow, staple fibres or<br /> waste, of headings 5501 to 5507.<br /> Note 6 \u2014 Tolerances applicable to products made of a mixture of textile materials<br /> 6.1. Where, for a given product in the list, reference is made to this Note, the conditions set out in column 3 shall not be<br /> applied to any basic textile materials used in the manufacture of this product and which, taken together, represent<br /> 10 % or less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 6.3 and 6.4)<br /> 6.2. However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 6.1 may be applied only to mixed products which have been made from<br /> two or more basic textile materials.<br /> The following are the basic textile materials:<br /> \u2014 silk;<br /> \u2014 wool;<br /> \u2014 coarse animal hair;<br /> \u2014 fine animal hair;<br /> \u2014 horsehair;<br /> \u2014 cotton;<br /> \u2014 paper-making materials and paper;<br /> \u2014 flax;<br /> \u2014 true hemp;<br /> \u2014 jute and other textile bast fibres;<br /> \u2014 sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave;<br /> \u2014 coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres;<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made filaments;<br /> L 344/61<br /> 19.12.2013<br /> \u2014 artificial man-made filaments;<br /> \u2014 current-conducting filaments;<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene;<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester;<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide;<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile;<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide;<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene;<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(phenylene sulphide);<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(vinyl chloride);<br /> \u2014 other synthetic man-made staple fibres;<br /> \u2014 artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose;<br /> \u2014 other artificial man-made staple fibres;<br /> \u2014 yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped;<br /> \u2014 yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester, whether or not gimped;<br /> \u2014 products of heading 5605 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a<br /> core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched<br /> by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film;<br /> \u2014 other products of heading 5605;<br /> \u2014 glass fibres;<br /> \u2014 metal fibres.<br /> Example:<br /> A yarn, of heading 5205, made from cotton fibres of heading 5203 and synthetic staple fibres of heading 5506, is a<br /> mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres which do not satisfy the origin rules may be used,<br /> provided that their total weight does not exceed 10 % of the weight of the yarn.<br /> Example:<br /> A woollen fabric, of heading 5112, made from woollen yarn of heading 5107 and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of<br /> heading 5509, is a mixed fabric. Therefore, synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules, or woollen yarn<br /> which does not satisfy the origin rules, or a combination of the two, may be used, provided that their total weight<br /> does not exceed 10 % of the weight of the fabric.<br /> Example:<br /> Tufted textile fabric, of heading 5802, made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and cotton fabric of heading 5210,<br /> is only a mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric made from yarns classified in two separate<br /> headings, or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.<br /> Example:<br /> If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and synthetic fabric of<br /> heading 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is,<br /> accordingly, a mixed product.<br /> 6.3. In the case of products incorporating \u2018yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether,<br /> whether or not gimped', the tolerance is 20 % in respect of this yarn.<br /> L 344/62<br /> 19.12.2013<br /> 6.4. In the case of products incorporating \u2018strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether<br /> or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or<br /> coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film', the tolerance is 30 % in respect of this strip.<br /> Note 7 \u2014 Other tolerances applicable to certain textile products<br /> 7.1. Where, in the list, reference is made to this Note, textile materials which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in<br /> column 3 for the made-up product concerned, may be used, provided that they are classified in a heading other than<br /> that of the product and that their value does not exceed 8 % of the ex-works price of the product.<br /> 7.2. Without prejudice to Note 7.3, materials, which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63, may be used freely in<br /> the manufacture of textile products, whether or not they contain textiles.<br /> Example:<br /> If a rule in the list provides that, for a particular textile item (such as trousers), yarn must be used, this does not<br /> prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because buttons are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63. For the<br /> same reason, it does not prevent the use of slide-fasteners, even though slide-fasteners normally contain textiles.<br /> 7.3. Where a percentage rule applies, the value of materials which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63 must be<br /> taken into account when calculating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.<br /> Note 8 \u2014 Definition of specific processes and simple operations carried out in respect of certain products of Chapter 27<br /> 8.1. For the purposes of headings ex 2707 and 2713, the \u2018specific processes' are the following:<br /> (a) vacuum-distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation-process (T):<br /> (c) cracking:<br /> (d) reforming:<br /> (e) extraction by means of selective solvents:<br /> (f) the process comprising all of the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or<br /> sulphuric anhydride: neutralisation with alkaline agents: decolourisation and purification with naturally-active<br /> earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite:<br /> (g) polymerisation:<br /> (h) alkylation:<br /> (i) isomerisation.<br /> 8.2. For the purposes of headings 2710, 2711 and 2712, the \u2018specific processes' are the following:<br /> (a) vacuum-distillation:<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation-process (T):<br /> (c) cracking:<br /> (d) reforming:<br /> (e) extraction by means of selective solvents:<br /> (f) the process comprising all of the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or<br /> sulphuric anhydride: neutralisation with alkaline agents: decolourisation and purification with naturally-active<br /> earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite:<br /> (g) polymerisation:<br /> (h) alkylation:<br /> (i) isomerisation:<br /> (') See additional explanatory Note 4(b) to Chapter 27 of the Combined Nomenclature.<br /> 19.12.2013<br /> L 344/63<br /> (j) in respect of heavy oils of heading ex 2710 only, desulphurisation with hydrogen, resulting in a reduction of at<br /> least 85 % of the sulphur-content of the products processed (ASTM D 1266-59 T method);<br /> (k) in respect of products of heading 2710 only, deparaffining by a process other than filtering;<br /> (l) in respect of heavy oils of heading ex 2710 only, treatment with hydrogen, at a pressure of more than 20 bar<br /> and a temperature of more than 250 \u00b0C, with the use of a catalyst, other than to effect desulphurisation, when<br /> the hydrogen constitutes an active element in a chemical reaction. The further treatment, with hydrogen, of<br /> lubricating oils of heading ex 2710 (e.g. hydrofinishing or decolourisation), in order, more especially, to improve<br /> colour or stability shall not, however, be deemed to be a specific process;<br /> (m) in respect of fuel oils of heading ex 2710 only, atmospheric distillation, on condition that less than 30 % of<br /> these products distils, by volume, including losses, at 300 \u00b0C, by the ASTM D 86 method;<br /> (n) in respect of heavy oils other than gas oils and fuel oils of heading ex 2710 only, treatment by means of a high-<br /> frequency electrical brush-discharge.<br /> (o) in respect of crude products (other than petroleum jelly, ozokerite, lignite wax or peat wax, paraffin wax<br /> containing by weight less than 0,75 % of oil) of heading ex 2712 only, de-oiling by fractional crystallisation.<br /> 8.3. For the purposes of headings ex 2707 and 2713, simple operations, such as cleaning, decanting, desalting, water-<br /> separation, filtering, colouring, marking, obtaining a sulphur-content as a result of mixing products with different<br /> sulphur-contents, or any combination of these operations or like operations, do not confer origin.", "ShowProductAffected": false, "ProductAffected": null, "RevisionName": null, "Rank": 0, "ShowRooExceptions": false, "RooExceptions": null}], "SpecificNote": [{"RooCode": null, "RooText": null, "ShowProductAffected": false, "ProductAffected": null, "RevisionName": null, "Rank": 0, "ShowRooExceptions": false, "RooExceptions": null}], "Documents": [{"DocDesc": "Certificate of origin", "DocFileName": "itc00176_coo.pdf", "DocType": "1_coo", "WebLink": null}, {"DocDesc": "Product-specific rules of origin", "DocFileName": "itc00176_sroo.pdf", "DocType": "2_sroo", "WebLink": null}, {"DocDesc": "Chapter on rules of origin", "DocFileName": "itc00176_roo.pdf", "DocType": "3_roo", "WebLink": null}, {"DocDesc": "Full text of agreement", "DocFileName": "itc00176_full.pdf", "DocType": "8_full", "WebLink": "https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:L:2013:344:FULL&from=EN"}]}, "FtaProvisions": {"RooProvision": [{"ProvisionAbbrev": "accum", "ProvisionCode": "Cumulation", "ProvisionValue": "full+cross-cumulation", "ProvisionRank": null, "ProvisionGlossary": "A provision which allows to consider goods obtained in as well as processing taking place in one FTA member country as originating in another.", "ProvisionGlossaryLink": "/en/glossary?uid=accum&returnto=gloscenter", "ProvisionLegalExtract": "Article 7 : Cumulation with the Union <br /> 1 Without prejudice to Article 2 of this Annex, materials <br /> originating in the Union shall be considered as materials originating in an OCTs when incorporated into a product obtained <br /> there, provided that they have undergone working or processing <br /> which goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 5(1). <br /> 2 Without prejudice to Article 2 of this Annex, working or <br /> processing carried out in the Union shall be considered as <br /> having been carried out in an OCTs, when the materials <br /> undergo subsequent working or processing there which goes <br /> beyond the operations referred to in Article 5(1) of this Annex. <br /> 3 For the purpose of cumulation provided for in this Article, the origin of the materials <br /> shall be established in accordance with this Annex. <br /> Article 8 : Cumulation with EPA countries <br /> 1 Without prejudice to Article 2 of this Annex, materials originating in the EPA countries shall be considered as materials <br /> originating in an OCTs when incorporated into a product obtained there, provided that they have undergone working or <br /> processing which goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 5(1) of this Annex. <br /> 2 Without prejudice to Article 2 of this Annex, working or <br /> processing carried out in the EPA countries shall be considered <br /> as having been carried out in an OCTs, when the materials <br /> undergo subsequent working or processing there which goes <br /> beyond the operations referred to in Article 5(1) of this Annex. <br /> 3 For the purpose of paragraph 1 of this Article, the origin of the materials originating in an EPA country shall be <br /> determined in accordance with the rules of origin applicable to the EPA concerned and relevant provisions on proofs <br /> of origin and administrative cooperation. <br /> The cumulation provided for in this Article shall not apply to the following: <br /> (a) materials originating in the Republic of South Africa which <br /> cannot be imported directly in the Union duty-free-quota- <br /> free in the framework of the EPA between the Union and the Southern African Development Community (SADC);

A specimen of a supplier's <br /> declaration appears in Appendix VII. In cases where the <br /> supplying OCTs has implemented the Registered Exporter <br /> System but the OCTs of further processing has not, the <br /> evidence of originating status may also be provided by means <br /> of a statement on origin. <br /> 2 For the purpose of Article 2(2) and Article 7(2) of this <br /> Annex, the evidence of working or processing carried out in <br /> another OCTs or in the Union shall be given by means of a supplier's declaration, provided by the exporter in the country from which the <br /> materials came.

The said customs authorities may <br /> lay down conditions for the implementation of this paragraph. <br /> The supplier's declarations are submitted to the competent customs office in the exporting OCTs <br /> requested to issue the movement certificate EUR.1. <br /> 4 When Articles 8 and 10 are applied, the evidence of originating status in accordance with the <br /> provisions of the relevant free trade agreement between the Union and the country concerned <br /> shall be given by the proofs of origin established by the relevant free trade agreement. <br /> 5 When Article 9 is applied, the evidence of originating <br /> status in accordance with the provisions laid down in <br /> Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 [1] shall be given <br /> by the proofs of origin established by the same Regulation. <br /> 6 In the cases referred to in paragraphs 1, 2, 4 and 5, Box 7 <br /> of movement certificate EUR.1 or the origin declaration or the <br /> statement on origin shall, where appropriate, contain the indication <br /> \u2018OCTs cumulation', \u2018EU cumulation', \u2018EPA cumulation', <br /> \u2018cumulation with GSP country' or \u2018extended cumulation with <br /> country x' or \u2018Cumul PTOM', \u2018Cumul UE', \u2018cumul avec pays <br /> APE', \u2018cumul avec pays SPG' or \u2018cumul \u00e9tendu avec le pays x'. <br /> [1] Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying <br /> down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation <br /> (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code (OJ L 253, 11.10.1993, p. 1). <br /> Article 34 : Preservation of proof of origin and supporting documents <br /> 1 The exporter applying for the issue of a movement certificate EUR.1 shall keep for at least three years the documents <br /> referred to in Article 22(3). <br /> 2 The exporter making out an origin declaration shall keep for at least three years a copy of this origin declaration as well as the <br /> documents referred to in Article 26(3). <br /> 3 The customs authorities of the exporting OCTs issuing a movement certificate EUR.1 shall keep for at least three years the <br /> application form referred to in Article 22(2). <br /> 4 The customs authorities of the importing country shall keep for at least three years the movement certificates EUR.1 and the <br /> origin declarations submitted to them. <br /> Article 36 : General requirements <br /> Benefits from this Decision shall apply in the following cases: <br /> (a) in cases of goods satisfying the requirements of this Annex <br /> exported by a registered exporter referred to in Article 38; <br /> (b) in cases of any consignment of one or more packages <br /> containing originating products exported by any exporter, <br /> where the total value of the originating products consigned does not exceed EUR 10 000. <br /> Article 41 : Proof of origin <br /> 1 A statement on origin shall be made out by the exporter when the products to which it relates are exported, if the goods concerned can <br /> be considered as originating in the OCTs. <br /> 2 By derogation from paragraph 1, a statement on origin <br /> may exceptionally be made out after exportation (retrospective <br /> statement) on condition that it is presented in the Member State <br /> of declaration for release for free circulation no longer than two <br /> years after the export. Where the splitting of a consignment <br /> takes place in accordance with Article 18 of this Annex, the <br /> statement on origin may also be made out retrospectively. <br /> 3 The statement on origin shall be provided by the exporter to his customer in the Union and shall contain the particulars specified in <br /> Appendix XII. A statement on origin shall be made out in either English or French. <br /> It may be made out on any commercial document allowing to identify the exporter concerned and the goods involved. <br /> 4 When cumulation under Articles 2 and 7 of this Annex <br /> applies, the exporter of a product, in the manufacture of which <br /> materials originating in an OCTs or in the Union are used, shall <br /> rely on the statement on origin provided by its supplier. In <br /> cases where the supplier is established in an OCTs that has <br /> not yet implemented the Registered Exporter System, the <br /> exporter in the OCTs of further processing may also rely on <br /> a movement certificate EUR.1, an origin declaration or a supplier's declaration. <br /> 5 In these cases, the statement on origin made out by the <br /> exporter shall, as the case may be, contain the indication \u2018EU <br /> cumulation', \u2018OCTs cumulation' or \u2018Cumul UE', \u2018cumul PTOM'. <br /> 6 When Articles 8 and 10 of this Annex are applied, the <br /> evidence of originating status, in accordance with the provisions <br /> of the relevant free trade agreement between the Union and the <br /> country concerned, shall be satisfied on the basis of the proofs <br /> of origin established by the relevant free trade agreement. <br /> In this case, the statement on origin made out by the exporter shall contain the indication \u2018cumulation with EPA country' or \u2018extended <br /> cumulation with country x' or \u2018cumul avec pays APE' or \u2018cumul \u00e9tendu avec le pays x'. <br /> 7 When cumulation of Article 9 of this Annex applies, the <br /> evidence of originating status established in accordance with the <br /> provisions laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93, shall be <br /> given by the proofs of origin established by the same Regulation. <br /> In this case, the statement on origin made out by the exporter shall contain the indication \u2018cumulation with GSP country' <br /> or \u2018cumul avec pays SPG'. <br /> Article 42 : Submission of a proof of origin <br /> 1 A statement on origin shall be made out for each consignment. <br /> 2 A statement on origin shall be valid for 12 months from the date of its making out by the exporter. <br /> 3 A single statement on origin may cover several consignments if the goods meet the following conditions: <br /> (a) they are dismantled or non-assembled products within the <br /> meaning of general rule 2(a) of the Harmonised System; <br /> (b) they fall within Section XVI or XVII or heading 7308 or <br /> 9406 of the Harmonised System; and <br /> (c) they are intended to be imported by instalments. <br /> Subsection 2 <br /> Procedures at release for free circulation in the Union <br /> Article 43 : Submission of proof of origin <br /> 1 The customs declaration for release for free circulation <br /> shall make reference to the statement on origin.

In other cases of belated presentation, the customs <br> authorities of the importing country may accept the statements on origin where the products have been presented to customs before <br> the said final date. <br> Article 47 : Procedure for importation by instalments <br> Procedure for importation by instalments <br> 1 The procedure referred to in Article 42(3) of this Annex shall apply for a period <br> determined by the customs authorities of the Member States. <br> 2 The customs authorities of the Member States of importation supervising the successive releases <br> for free circulation shall verify that the successive consignments are part of the dismantled or <br> non-assembled products for which the statement on origin has been made out. <br> Article 48 : Replacement of a statement of origin <br> Replacement of a statement of origin <br> 1 Where products have not yet been released for free circulation, a statement on origin may be replaced by one or more replacement <br> statements on origin, made out by the holder of the goods, for the purpose of sending all or some of the products elsewhere within <br> the customs territory of the Union. For the purpose of being entitled to make out replacement statements on origin, holders of the <br> goods need not be registered exporters themselves. <br> 2 Where a statement on origin is replaced, the original statement on origin shall indicate the following: <br> (a) the particulars of the replacement statement(s) on origin; <br> (b) the names and addresses of the consignor; <br> (c) the consignee(s) in the Union. <br> The original statement on origin shall be marked as \u2018Replaced' or \u2018Remplac\u00e9e', as the case may be. <br> 3 On the replacement statement on origin the following shall be indicated: <br> (a) all particulars of the re-consigned products;

<br> (b) the declarant does not reply within the time period allowed <br> for provision of the information referred to in paragraph 1. <br> 3 While awaiting either the information requested from the declarant referred to in paragraph 1, or the results of the verifi\u00ad cation <br> procedure referred to in paragraph 2, release of the products shall be offered to the importer subject to any precautionary <br> measures deemed necessary. <br> Article 50 : Denial of preferences <br> Denial of preferences <br> 1 The customs authorities of the Member State of <br> importation shall refuse entitlement to the benefits of this <br> Decision, without being obliged to request any additional <br> evidence or send a request for verification to the OCTs where: <br> (a) the goods are not the same as those mentioned in the <br> statement on origin;

The said customs authorities may <br> lay down conditions for the implementation of this paragraph. <br> The supplier's declarations are submitted to the competent customs office in the exporting OCTs <br> requested to issue the movement certificate EUR.1. <br> (b) documents proving the originating status of materials used, <br> 4 When Articles 8 and 10 are applied, the evidence of originating status in accordance with the <br> provisions of the relevant free trade agreement between the Union and the country concerned <br> shall be given by the proofs of origin established by the relevant free trade agreement. <br> 5 When Article 9 is applied, the evidence of originating <br> (c) documents proving the working or processing of materials <br> status in accordance with the provisions laid down in <br> Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 [1] shall be given <br> by the proofs of origin established by the same Regulation. <br> 6 In the cases referred to in paragraphs 1, 2, 4 and 5, Box 7 <br> of movement certificate EUR.1 or the origin declaration or the <br> statement on origin shall, where appropriate, contain the indication <br> that this document does correspond to the products submitted. <br> the originating status of materials used, issued or made out <br> \u2018OCTs cumulation', \u2018EU cumulation', \u2018EPA cumulation', <br> \u2018cumulation with GSP country' or \u2018extended cumulation with <br> country x' or \u2018Cumul PTOM', \u2018Cumul UE', \u2018cumul avec pays <br> APE', \u2018cumul avec pays SPG' or \u2018cumul \u00e9tendu avec le pays x'. <br> [1] Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying <br> down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation <br> (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code (OJ L 253, 11.10.1993, p. 1). <br> Article 33 : Supporting documents <br> The documents referred to in Article 22(3) and Article 26(3), <br> used for the purpose of proving that products covered by a <br> movement certificate EUR.1 or an origin declaration can be <br> considered as products originating in an OCTs or in the <br> Union or in an EPA country, and fulfil the other requirements <br> of this Annex, may consist, inter alia, of the following: <br> (a) direct evidence of the processes carried out by the exporter <br> or supplier to obtain the goods concerned, contained for <br> issued or made out in an OCTs, or in the Union or in an <br> EPA State where these documents are used in accordance with domestic law; <br> in the OCTs, in the Union, or in an EPA country, issued or <br> made out in an OCTs, in the Union or in an EPA country, where these documents are used in accordance with domestic law; <br> (d) movement certificates EUR.1 or origin declarations proving <br> in the OCTs, in the Union or in an EPA country and in accordance with this Annex. <br> Article 34 : Preservation of proof of origin and supporting documents <br> 1 The exporter applying for the issue of a movement certificate EUR.1 shall keep for at least three years the documents <br> referred to in Article 22(3). <br> 2 The exporter making out an origin declaration shall keep for at least three years a copy of this origin declaration as well as the <br> documents referred to in Article 26(3). <br> 3 The customs authorities of the exporting OCTs issuing a movement certificate EUR.1 shall keep for at least three years the <br> application form referred to in Article 22(2). <br> 4 The customs authorities of the importing country shall keep for at least three years the movement certificates EUR.1 and the <br> origin declarations submitted to them. <br> statements made in the proof of origin and those made in <br> the documents submitted to the customs office for the purpose of carrying out the formalities for importing the products shall <br> not ipso facto render the proof of origin null and void if it is duly established <br> 2 Obvious formal errors such as typing errors on a proof of origin should not cause this document to be rejected if these errors are not <br> such as to create doubts concerning the correctness of the statements made in this document. <br> Section 3 <br> Procedures for the registered exporters system <br> Sub-section 1 <br> Procedures at export in the OCTs <br> Article 36 : General requirements <br> Benefits from this Decision shall apply in the following cases: <br> (a) in cases of goods satisfying the requirements of this Annex <br> exported by a registered exporter referred to in Article 38; <br> (b) in cases of any consignment of one or more packages <br> containing originating products exported by any exporter, <br> where the total value of the originating products consigned does not exceed EUR 10 000. <br> Article 37 : Record of registered exporters <br> Record of registered exporters <br> 1 The competent authorities of the OCTs shall establish and <br> keep up to date at all times an electronic record of registered <br> exporters located in that country. The record shall be <br> immediately updated where an exporter is withdrawn from <br> the register in accordance with Article 41(2) of this Annex. <br> 2 The record shall contain the following information: <br> (a) name and full address of the place where the registered <br> exporter is established/resides, including the identifier of <br> the country or territory (ISO alpha 2 country code); <br> (b) number of the registered exporter; <br> (c) products intended to be exported under this Decision <br> (indicative list of Harmonised System chapters or headings <br> as considered appropriate by the applicant); <br> (d) dates as from and until when the exporter is/was registered; <br> (e) the reason for withdrawal (registered exporter's request/ <br> withdrawal by competent authorities).

The number shall begin with an ISO alpha 2 country code. <br> Article 38 : Request for registration <br> Request for registration <br> To be registered, exporters shall lodge an application with the competent authorities of the OCTs referred to in Article 57(1) of this <br> Annex, using the form a model of which is set out in Appendix XI. By the completion of the form, exporters give consent to the <br> storage of the information provided in the database of the Commission and to the publication of non- <br> confidential data on the internet. <br> The application shall be accepted by the competent authorities only if it is complete. <br> Article 39 : Withdrawal of the registration <br> Withdrawal of the registration <br> 1 Registered exporters who no longer meet the conditions <br> for exporting any goods benefiting from this Decision, or no <br> longer intend to export such goods, shall inform the competent <br> authorities in the OCTs who shall immediately remove them <br> from the record of registered exporters kept in that OCTs. <br> 2 Without prejudice to the system of penalties and sanctions applicable in the OCTs, where registered exporters intentionally or <br> negligently draw up, or cause to be drawn up, a statement on origin or any supporting document which contains incorrect information <br> which leads to irregularly or fraudulently obtaining the benefit of preferential tariff treatment, the OCTs competent authorities shall <br> withdraw the exporter from the record of registered exporters kept by the OCTs concerned. <br> 3 Without prejudice to the possible impact of irregularities <br> found on pending verifications, withdrawal from the record of <br> registered exporters shall take effect for the future, namely in <br> respect of statements made out after the date of withdrawal. <br> 4 Exporters who have been removed from the record of registered exporters by the competent authorities in accordance with <br> paragraph 2 may only be re-introduced into the record of registered exporters once they have proved to the competent authorities in <br> the OCTs that they have remedied the situation which led to their withdrawal. <br> Article 40 : Supporting documents <br> 1 Exporters, registered or not, shall comply with the following obligations: <br> (a) they shall maintain appropriate commercial accounting <br> records for production and supply of goods qualifying for <br> preferential treatment; <br> (b) they shall keep available all evidence relating to the material <br> used in the manufacture; <br> (c) they shall keep all customs documentation relating to the <br> material used in the manufacture; <br> (d) they shall keep for at least three years from the end of the <br> year in which the statement on origin was made out, or <br> more if required by national law, records of: <br> (i) the statements on origin they made out; and <br> (ii) their originating and non-original materials <br> production and stock accounts. <br> 2 The records referred to in point (d) of paragraph 1 may be electronic but shall allow the materials used in the manufacture of the <br> exported products to be traced and their originating status to be confirmed. <br> 3 The obligations provided for in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall <br> also apply to suppliers who provide exporters with supplier's <br> declarations certifying the originating status of the goods they supply. <br> Article 41 : Proof of origin <br> 1 A statement on origin shall be made out by the exporter when the products to which it relates are exported, if the goods concerned can <br> be considered as originating in the OCTs. <br> 2 By derogation from paragraph 1, a statement on origin <br> may exceptionally be made out after exportation (retrospective <br> statement) on condition that it is presented in the Member State <br> of declaration for release for free circulation no longer than two <br> years after the export. Where the splitting of a consignment <br> takes place in accordance with Article 18 of this Annex, the <br> statement on origin may also be made out retrospectively. <br> 3 The statement on origin shall be provided by the exporter to his customer in the Union and shall contain the particulars specified in <br> Appendix XII. A statement on origin shall be made out in either English or French. <br> It may be made out on any commercial document allowing to identify the exporter concerned and the goods involved. <br> 4 When cumulation under Articles 2 and 7 of this Annex <br> applies, the exporter of a product, in the manufacture of which <br> materials originating in an OCTs or in the Union are used, shall <br> rely on the statement on origin provided by its supplier. In <br> cases where the supplier is established in an OCTs that has <br> not yet implemented the Registered Exporter System, the <br> exporter in the OCTs of further processing may also rely on <br> a movement certificate EUR.1, an origin declaration or a supplier's declaration. <br> 5 In these cases, the statement on origin made out by the <br> exporter shall, as the case may be, contain the indication \u2018EU <br> cumulation', \u2018OCTs cumulation' or \u2018Cumul UE', \u2018cumul PTOM'. <br> 6 When Articles 8 and 10 of this Annex are applied, the <br> evidence of originating status, in accordance with the provisions <br> of the relevant free trade agreement between the Union and the <br> country concerned, shall be satisfied on the basis of the proofs <br> of origin established by the relevant free trade agreement. <br> In this case, the statement on origin made out by the exporter shall contain the indication \u2018cumulation with EPA country' or \u2018extended <br> cumulation with country x' or \u2018cumul avec pays APE' or \u2018cumul \u00e9tendu avec le pays x'. <br> 7 When cumulation of Article 9 of this Annex applies, the <br> evidence of originating status established in accordance with the <br> provisions laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93, shall be <br> given by the proofs of origin established by the same Regulation. <br> In this case, the statement on origin made out by the exporter shall contain the indication \u2018cumulation with GSP country' <br> or \u2018cumul avec pays SPG'. <br> Article 42 : Submission of a proof of origin <br> Submission of a proof of origin <br> 1 A statement on origin shall be made out for each consignment. <br> 2 A statement on origin shall be valid for 12 months from the date of its making out by the exporter. <br> 3 A single statement on origin may cover several consignments if the goods meet the following conditions: <br> (a) they are dismantled or non-assembled products within the <br> meaning of general rule 2(a) of the Harmonised System; <br> (b) they fall within Section XVI or XVII or heading 7308 or <br> 9406 of the Harmonised System; and <br> (c) they are intended to be imported by instalments. <br> Subsection 2 <br> Procedures at release for free circulation in the Union <br> Article 43 : Submission of proof of origin <br> 1 The customs declaration for release for free circulation <br> shall make reference to the statement on origin. The <br> statement on origin shall be kept at the disposal of the <br> customs authorities, which may request its submission for the <br> verification of the declaration. Those authorities may also <br> require a translation of the statement into the official <br> language, or one of the official languages, of the Member State concerned. <br> 2 Where the application of the benefits from this Decision is <br> requested by the declarant, without a statement on origin being <br> in his possession at the time of the acceptance of the customs <br> declaration for release for free circulation, that declaration shall <br> be considered as being incomplete within the meaning of <br> Article 253(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 and treated accordingly. <br> 3 Before declaring goods for release for free circulation, the declarant shall take due care that the goods comply with the rules in this <br> Annex by, in particular, checking: <br> (a) in the database referred to in Article 58 of this Annex that <br> the exporter is registered to make statements on origin, <br> except where the total value of the originating products consigned does not exceed EUR 10 000; and <br> (b) that the statement on origin is made out in accordance with Appendix XII. <br> Article 44 : Exemption from proof of origin <br> 1 The following products shall be exempted from the <br> obligation to make out and produce a statement on origin: <br> (a) products sent as small packages from private persons to <br> private persons, the total value of which does not exceed EUR 500; <br> (b) products forming part of travellers' personal luggage, the <br> total value of which does not exceed EUR 1200. <br> 2 The products referred to in paragraph 1 shall meet the following conditions: <br> (a) they are not imported by way of trade; <br> (b) they have been declared as meeting the conditions for benefiting from this Decision; <br> (c) there is no doubt as to the veracity of the declaration <br> referred to in point (b). <br> 3 For the purposes of point (a) of paragraph 2, imports shall not be considered as imports by <br> way of trade if all the following conditions are met: <br> (b) the imports consist solely of products for the personal use <br> of the recipients or travellers or their families; <br> (c) it is evident from the nature and quantity of the products <br> that no commercial purpose is in view. <br> Article 45 : Discrepancies and formal errors <br> 1 The discovery of slight discrepancies between the <br> particulars included in a statement on origin and those <br> mentioned in the documents submitted to the customs authorities for the purpose of carrying out the formalities for <br> importing the products shall not ipso facto render the <br> statement on origin null and void if it is duly established that <br> that document does correspond to the products concerned. <br> 2 Obvious formal errors such as typing errors on a <br> statement on origin shall not cause this document to be <br> rejected if these errors are not such as to create doubts <br> concerning the correctness of the statements made in that document. <br> Article 46 : Validity of proof of origin <br> Statements on origin which are submitted to the customs authorities of the importing country after the period of validity mentioned <br> in Article 41(2) of this Annex may be accepted for the purpose of applying the tariff preferences, where failure to submit <br> these documents by the final date set is due to exceptional circumstances. In other cases of belated presentation, the customs <br> authorities of the importing country may accept the statements on origin where the products have been presented to customs before <br> the said final date. <br> Article 47 : Procedure for importation by instalments <br> Procedure for importation by instalments <br> 1 The procedure referred to in Article 42(3) of this Annex shall apply for a period <br> determined by the customs authorities of the Member States. <br> 2 The customs authorities of the Member States of importation supervising the successive releases <br> for free circulation shall verify that the successive consignments are part of the dismantled or <br> non-assembled products for which the statement on origin has been made out. <br> Article 48 : Replacement of a statement of origin <br> Replacement of a statement of origin <br> 1 Where products have not yet been released for free circulation, a statement on origin may be replaced by one or more replacement <br> statements on origin, made out by the holder of the goods, for the purpose of sending all or some of the products elsewhere within <br> the customs territory of the Union. For the purpose of being entitled to make out replacement statements on origin, holders of the <br> goods need not be registered exporters themselves. <br> 2 Where a statement on origin is replaced, the original statement on origin shall indicate the following: <br> (a) the particulars of the replacement statement(s) on origin; <br> (b) the names and addresses of the consignor; <br> (c) the consignee(s) in the Union. <br> The original statement on origin shall be marked as \u2018Replaced' or \u2018Remplac\u00e9e', as the case may be. <br> 3 On the replacement statement on origin the following shall be indicated: <br> (a) all particulars of the re-consigned products;

<br> (b) the declarant does not reply within the time period allowed <br> for provision of the information referred to in paragraph 1. <br> 3 While awaiting either the information requested from the declarant referred to in paragraph 1, or the results of the verifi\u00ad cation <br> procedure referred to in paragraph 2, release of the products shall be offered to the importer subject to any precautionary <br> measures deemed necessary. <br> Article 50 : Denial of preferences <br> Denial of preferences <br> 1 The customs authorities of the Member State of <br> importation shall refuse entitlement to the benefits of this <br> Decision, without being obliged to request any additional <br> evidence or send a request for verification to the OCTs where: <br> (a) the goods are not the same as those mentioned in the <br> statement on origin;

In <br> cases where the supplier is established in an OCTs that has <br> not yet implemented the Registered Exporter System, the <br> exporter in the OCTs of further processing may also rely on <br> a movement certificate EUR.1, an origin declaration or a supplier's declaration. <br> 5 In these cases, the statement on origin made out by the <br> exporter shall, as the case may be, contain the indication \u2018EU <br> cumulation', \u2018OCTs cumulation' or \u2018Cumul UE', \u2018cumul PTOM'. <br> 6 When Articles 8 and 10 of this Annex are applied, the <br> evidence of originating status, in accordance with the provisions <br> of the relevant free trade agreement between the Union and the <br> country concerned, shall be satisfied on the basis of the proofs <br> of origin established by the relevant free trade agreement. <br> In this case, the statement on origin made out by the exporter shall contain the indication \u2018cumulation with EPA country' or \u2018extended <br> cumulation with country x' or \u2018cumul avec pays APE' or \u2018cumul \u00e9tendu avec le pays x'. <br> 7 When cumulation of Article 9 of this Annex applies, the <br> evidence of originating status established in accordance with the <br> provisions laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93, shall be <br> given by the proofs of origin established by the same Regulation. <br> In this case, the statement on origin made out by the exporter shall contain the indication \u2018cumulation with GSP country' <br> or \u2018cumul avec pays SPG'. <br> Article 42 : Submission of a proof of origin <br> Submission of a proof of origin <br> 1 A statement on origin shall be made out for each consignment. <br> 2 A statement on origin shall be valid for 12 months from the date of its making out by the exporter. <br> 3 A single statement on origin may cover several consignments if the goods meet the following conditions: <br> (a) they are dismantled or non-assembled products within the <br> meaning of general rule 2(a) of the Harmonised System; <br> (b) they fall within Section XVI or XVII or heading 7308 or <br> 9406 of the Harmonised System; and <br> (c) they are intended to be imported by instalments. <br> Subsection 2 <br> Procedures at release for free circulation in the Union <br> Article 43 : Submission of proof of origin <br> 1 The customs declaration for release for free circulation <br> shall make reference to the statement on origin. The <br> statement on origin shall be kept at the disposal of the <br> customs authorities, which may request its submission for the <br> verification of the declaration. Those authorities may also <br> require a translation of the statement into the official <br> language, or one of the official languages, of the Member State concerned. <br> 2 Where the application of the benefits from this Decision is <br> requested by the declarant, without a statement on origin being <br> in his possession at the time of the acceptance of the customs <br> declaration for release for free circulation, that declaration shall <br> be considered as being incomplete within the meaning of <br> Article 253(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 and treated accordingly. <br> 3 Before declaring goods for release for free circulation, the declarant shall take due care that the goods comply with the rules in this <br> Annex by, in particular, checking: <br> (a) in the database referred to in Article 58 of this Annex that <br> the exporter is registered to make statements on origin, <br> except where the total value of the originating products consigned does not exceed EUR 10 000; and <br> (b) that the statement on origin is made out in accordance with Appendix XII. <br> Article 44 : Exemption from proof of origin <br> 1 The following products shall be exempted from the <br> obligation to make out and produce a statement on origin: <br> (a) products sent as small packages from private persons to <br> private persons, the total value of which does not exceed EUR 500; <br> (b) products forming part of travellers' personal luggage, the <br> total value of which does not exceed EUR 1200. <br> 2 The products referred to in paragraph 1 shall meet the following conditions: <br> (a) they are not imported by way of trade; <br> (b) they have been declared as meeting the conditions for benefiting from this Decision; <br> (c) there is no doubt as to the veracity of the declaration <br> referred to in point (b). <br> 3 For the purposes of point (a) of paragraph 2, imports shall not be considered as imports by <br> way of trade if all the following conditions are met: <br> (b) the imports consist solely of products for the personal use <br> of the recipients or travellers or their families; <br> (c) it is evident from the nature and quantity of the products <br> that no commercial purpose is in view. <br> Article 45 : Discrepancies and formal errors <br> 1 The discovery of slight discrepancies between the <br> particulars included in a statement on origin and those <br> mentioned in the documents submitted to the customs authorities for the purpose of carrying out the formalities for <br> importing the products shall not ipso facto render the <br> statement on origin null and void if it is duly established that <br> that document does correspond to the products concerned. <br> 2 Obvious formal errors such as typing errors on a <br> statement on origin shall not cause this document to be <br> rejected if these errors are not such as to create doubts <br> concerning the correctness of the statements made in that document. <br> Article 46 : Validity of proof of origin <br> Statements on origin which are submitted to the customs authorities of the importing country after the period of validity mentioned <br> in Article 41(2) of this Annex may be accepted for the purpose of applying the tariff preferences, where failure to submit <br> these documents by the final date set is due to exceptional circumstances. In other cases of belated presentation, the customs <br> authorities of the importing country may accept the statements on origin where the products have been presented to customs before <br> the said final date. <br> Article 47 : Procedure for importation by instalments <br> Procedure for importation by instalments <br> 1 The procedure referred to in Article 42(3) of this Annex shall apply for a period <br> determined by the customs authorities of the Member States. <br> 2 The customs authorities of the Member States of importation supervising the successive releases <br> for free circulation shall verify that the successive consignments are part of the dismantled or <br> non-assembled products for which the statement on origin has been made out. <br> Article 48 : Replacement of a statement of origin <br> Replacement of a statement of origin <br> 1 Where products have not yet been released for free circulation, a statement on origin may be replaced by one or more replacement <br> statements on origin, made out by the holder of the goods, for the purpose of sending all or some of the products elsewhere within <br> the customs territory of the Union. For the purpose of being entitled to make out replacement statements on origin, holders of the <br> goods need not be registered exporters themselves. <br> 2 Where a statement on origin is replaced, the original statement on origin shall indicate the following: <br> (a) the particulars of the replacement statement(s) on origin; <br> (b) the names and addresses of the consignor; <br> (c) the consignee(s) in the Union. <br> The original statement on origin shall be marked as \u2018Replaced' or \u2018Remplac\u00e9e', as the case may be. <br> 3 On the replacement statement on origin the following shall be indicated: <br> (a) all particulars of the re-consigned products; <br> (b) the date on which the original statement on origin was made out; <br> (c) all the necessary details to be mentioned, as specified under Appendix XII; <br> (d) the name and address of the consignor of the products in the Union;

<br> (b) the declarant does not reply within the time period allowed <br> for provision of the information referred to in paragraph 1. <br> 3 While awaiting either the information requested from the declarant referred to in paragraph 1, or the results of the verifi\u00ad cation <br> procedure referred to in paragraph 2, release of the products shall be offered to the importer subject to any precautionary <br> measures deemed necessary. <br> Article 50 : Denial of preferences <br> Denial of preferences <br> 1 The customs authorities of the Member State of <br> importation shall refuse entitlement to the benefits of this <br> Decision, without being obliged to request any additional <br> evidence or send a request for verification to the OCTs where: <br> (a) the goods are not the same as those mentioned in the <br> statement on origin; <br> (b) the declarant fails to submit a statement on origin for the <br> products concerned, where such a statement is required; <br> (c) without prejudice to point (b) of Article 36 and to Article 44(1) of this Annex, <br> the statement on origin in possession of the declarant has not been made out by an exporter registered in the OCTs;

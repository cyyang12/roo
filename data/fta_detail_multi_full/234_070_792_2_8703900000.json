The first column gives the<br /> heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonized System and the second<br /> column gives the description of goods used in that system for that heading or chapter.<br /> For each entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in columns 3 or 4. Where, in<br /> some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an \"ex\", this signifies that the<br /> rules in columns 3 or 4 apply only to the part of that heading or chapter as described in<br /> column 2.<br /> 2.2. Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number is<br /> given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the<br /> adjacent rules in columns 3 or 4 apply to all products which, under the Harmonized<br /> System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in any of the headings grouped<br /> together in column 1.<br /> 2.3. Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading,<br /> each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent<br /> rules in columns 3 or 4.<br /> 2.4. Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns 3 and 4,<br /> the exporter may opt, as an alternative, to apply either the rule set out in column 3 or that<br /> set out in column 4. If no origin rule is given in column 4, the rule set out in column 3 is<br /> to be applied.<br /> Note 3:<br /> 3.1. The provisions of Article 5 of this Protocol concerning products having acquired<br /> originating status which are used in the manufacture of other products, shall apply,<br /> regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where these<br /> products are used of in another factory in a Party.<br /> Example:<br /> An engine of heading 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-originating<br /> materials which may be incorporated may not exceed 40 per cent of the ex-works price,<br /> is made from other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging of heading ex 7224.<br /> If this forging has been forged in a Party concerned from a non-originating ingot, it has<br /> already acquired originating status by virtue of the rule for heading ex 7224 in the list.<br /> The forging can then count as originating in the value calculation for the engine<br /> regardless of whether it was produced in the same factory or in another factory in the<br /> Party concerned. The value of the non-originating ingot is thus not taken into account<br /> when adding up the value of the non-originating materials used.<br /> 3.2. The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing required<br /> and the carrying out of more working or processing also confers originating status;<br /> conversely, the carrying out of less working or processing cannot confer originating<br /> status. Thus if a rule provides that non-originating material at a certain level of<br /> manufacture may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is<br /> allowed and the use of such material at a later stage is not.<br /> 3.3. Without prejudice to Note 3.2 where a rule uses the expression \"Manufacture from<br /> materials of any heading\", than materials of any heading(s) (even materials of the same<br /> description and heading as the product) may be used, subject, however, to any specific<br /> limitations which may also be contained in the rule.<br /> However, the expression \"Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other<br /> materials of heading ...\" or \"Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other<br /> materials of the same heading as the product\" means that materials of any heading(s)<br /> may be used, except those of the same description as the product as given in column 2 of<br /> the list.<br /> 3.4. When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one<br /> material, this means that any one or more materials may be used. It does not require that<br /> all be used.<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for fabrics of heading 5208 to 5212 provides that natural fibre may be used and<br /> that chemical materials, among other materials, may also be used. This does not mean<br /> that both have to be used; it is possible to use one or the other or both.<br /> 3.5. Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular<br /> material, the condition obviously does not prevent the use of other materials which,<br /> because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule. (See also Note 6.2 below in<br /> relation to textiles).<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for prepared foods of heading 1904 which specifically excludes the use of<br /> cereals and their derivatives does not prevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and<br /> other additives which are not produced from cereals.<br /> However, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be manufactured<br /> from the particular material specified in the list, can be produced from a material of the<br /> same nature at an earlier stage of manufacture.<br /> Example:<br /> In the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 made from non-woven materials, if<br /> the use of only non-originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is not possible<br /> to start from non-woven cloth - even if non-woven cloths cannot normally be made from<br /> yarn. In such cases, the starting material would normally be at the stage before yarn - that<br /> is the fibre stage.<br /> 3.6. Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of<br /> non-originating materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be added<br /> together. In other words, the maximum value of all the non- originating materials used<br /> may never exceed the highest of the percentages given. Furthermore, the individual<br /> percentages must not be exceeded in relation to the particular materials they apply to.<br /> Note 4:<br /> 4.1. The term \"natural fibres\" is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or<br /> synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste,<br /> and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres that have been carded, combed or<br /> otherwise processed but not spun.<br /> 4.2. The term \"natural fibres\" includes horsehair of heading 0503, silk of heading 5002 and<br /> 5003 as well as the wool fibres, fine or coarse animal hair of heading 5101 to 5105, the<br /> cotton fibres of heading 5201 to 5203 and the other vegetable fibres of heading 5301 to<br /> 5305<br /> 4.3. The terms \"textile pulp\", \"chemical materials\" and \"paper-making materials\" are used in<br /> the list to describe the materials not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to<br /> manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.<br /> 4.4. The term \"man-made staple fibres\" is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial<br /> filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of heading 5501 to 5507.<br /> Note 5:<br /> 5.1. Where for a given product in the list a reference is made to this Note, the conditions set<br /> out in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials, used in the<br /> manufacture of this product, which, taken together, represent 10 per cent or less of the<br /> total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 5.3 and 5.4 below).<br /> 5.2. However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 5.1 may only be applied to mixed products<br /> which have been made from two or more basic textile materials.<br /> The following are the basic textile materials:<br /> - silk,<br /> - wool,<br /> - coarse animal hair,<br /> - fine animal hair,<br /> - horsehair,<br /> - cotton,<br /> - paper-making materials and paper,<br /> - flax,<br /> - true hemp,<br /> - jute and other textile bast fibres,<br /> - sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave,<br /> - coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,<br /> - synthetic man-made filaments<br /> - artificial man-made filaments,<br /> - current conducting filaments,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(phenylene sulphide),<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(vinyl chloride),<br /> - other synthetic man-made staple fibres,<br /> - artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose,<br /> - other artificial man-made staple fibres<br /> - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether<br /> whether or not gimped,<br /> - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester<br /> whether or not gimped,<br /> - products of heading 5605 (moralized yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a<br /> core of aluminium foil or a core of plastic film whether or not coated with<br /> aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of<br /> transparent or colored adhesive between two layers of plastic film,<br /> - other products of heading 5605.<br /> Example:<br /> A yarn of heading 5205 made from cotton fibres of heading 5203 and synthetic staple<br /> fibres of heading 5506 is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres<br /> that do not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials<br /> or textile pulp) may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10 per cent<br /> of the weight of the yarn.<br /> Example:<br /> A woollen fabric of heading 5112 made from woollen yarn of heading 5107 and<br /> synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading 5509 is a mixed fabric. Therefore synthetic<br /> yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from chemical<br /> materials or textile pulp) or woollen yarn that does not satisfy the origin rules (which<br /> require manufacture from natural fibres, not carded or combed or otherwise prepared for<br /> spinning) or a combination of the two may be used, provided that their total weight does<br /> not exceed 10 per cent of the weight of the fabric.<br /> Example:<br /> Tufted textile fabric of heading 5802 made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and cotton<br /> fabric of heading 5210 is only a mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric<br /> being made from yarns classified in two separate headings or if the cotton yarns used are<br /> themselves mixtures.<br /> Example:<br /> If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading 5205<br /> and synthetic fabric of heading 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate<br /> basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is accordingly a mixed product.<br /> 5.3. In the case of products incorporating \"yarn made of polyurethane segmented with<br /> flexible segments of polyether whether or not gimped\" this tolerance is 20 per cent in<br /> respect of this yarn.<br /> 5.4. In the case of products incorporating \"strip consisting of a core of aluminum foil or of a<br /> core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminum powder, of a width not<br /> exceeding 5 mm, sandwiches by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between<br /> two layers of plastic film\", this tolerance is 30 per cent in respect of this strip.<br /> Note 6:<br /> 6.1. Where, in the list, reference is made to this Note, textile materials (with the exception of<br /> linings and interlinings), which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3 for<br /> the made up product concerned, may be used, provided that they are classified in a<br /> heading other than that of the product and that their value does not exceed 8 per cent of<br /> the ex- works price of the product.<br /> 6.2. Without prejudice to Note 6.3, materials, which are not classified within Chapters 50 to<br /> 63, may be used freely in the manufacture of textile products, whether or not they<br /> contain textiles.<br /> Example:<br /> If a rule in the list provides that, for a particular textile item (such as trousers), yarn must<br /> be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because buttons are<br /> not classified within Chapters 50 to 63. For the same reason, it does not prevent the use<br /> of slide-fasteners even though slide-fasteners normally contain textiles.<br /> 6.3. Where a percentage rule applies, the value of materials which are not classified within<br /> Chapter 50 to 63 must be taken into account when calculating the value of the<br /> non-originating materials incorporated.<br /> Note 7:<br /> 7.1. For the purposes of heading ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex 3403, the<br /> \"specific processes\" are the following:<br /> (a) vacuum distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process<br /> (c) cracking;<br /> (d) reforming;<br /> (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f) the process comprising all the following operations: processing with<br /> concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralization with<br /> alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification with naturally active earth,<br /> activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;<br /> (g) polymerization;<br /> (h) alkylation;<br /> (i) isomerization;<br /> 7.2. For the purposes of heading 2710, 2711 and 2712, the \"specific processes\" are the<br /> following:<br /> (a) vacuum distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;<br /> (c) cracking;<br /> (d) reforming;<br /> (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f) the process comprising all the following operations: processing with<br /> concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralization with<br /> alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification with naturally active earth,<br /> activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;<br /> (g) polymerization;<br /> (h) alkylation;<br /> (i) isomerization;<br /> (k) in respect of heavy oils falling within heading ex 2710 only, desulphurization<br /> with hydrogen resulting in a reduction of at least 85 per cent of the sulphur<br /> content of the products processed (ASTM D 1266-59 T method);<br /> (l) in respect of products falling within heading 2710 only, deparaffining by a<br /> process other than filtering;<br /> (m) in respect of heavy oils falling within heading ex 2710 only, treatment with<br /> hydrogen at a pressure of more than 20 bar and a temperature of more than 250o<br /> C with the use of a catalyst, other than to effect desulphurisation, when the<br /> hydrogen constitutes an active element in a chemical reaction. The further<br /> treatment with hydrogen of lubricating oils of heading ex<br /> hydrofinishing or decolourisation) in order, more especially, to improve color or<br /> stability shall not, however, be deemed to be a specific process;<br /> (n) in respect of fuel oils falling within heading ex 2710 only, atmospheric<br /> distillation, on condition that less than 30 per cent of these products distills, by<br /> volume, including losses, at 3000C by the ASTM D 86 method;<br /> (o) in respect of heavy oils other than gas oils and fuel oils falling within heading ex<br /> 2710 only, treatment by means of a high-frequency electrical brush-discharge.<br /> (p) in respect of crude products of heading ex 2712 (other than petroleum jelly,<br /> ozokerite, lignite wax or peat wax, paraffin wax containing by weight less than<br /> 0,75 per cent of oil) only, de-oiling by fractional crystallization.<br /> 7.3.

The following criteria shall apply, as appropriate and as indicated<br /> in Part 1 in respect of each chapter, heading or sub-heading given in column 1:<br /> (i) working or processing of certain wholly produced materials;<br /> (ii) working or processing where the value of all the non-originating materials<br /> used in manufacture does not exceed a certain maximum threshold;<br /> (iii) working or processing where the 4-digit Harmonized System heading or<br /> 6-digit Harmonized System sub-heading of the manufactured products<br /> becomes different from the 4-digit Harmonized System heading or 6-digit<br /> sub-heading respectively of the materials used.;<br /> (iv) a specific working or processing operation is carried out.<br /> 1.2 The above origin criteria may be applied independent of each other or as<br /> alternatives as specified in Part 1.<br /> 1.3 Examples: Application of Note 1.1(ii)<br /> (a) Where the maximum amount of non-originating materials used in<br /> manufacture does not exceed 70% of the ex-works price of the finished<br /> product, it means that the minimum value added by a producer in a Partner<br /> State is 30% of the ex-works price of the given product.<br /> (b) Where for products of headings 87.11 to 87.12, the maximum amount of<br /> non-originating materials used in manufacture does not exceed 70% of the<br /> ex-works price of the finished product, it means that the minimum value<br /> added by a producer in a Partner State is 30% of the ex-works price of the<br /> given product<br /> Note 2: Structure of Part 1<br /> 2.1 The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column<br /> gives the heading number, sub-heading number or chapter number used in the<br /> Harmonized System and the second column gives the description of goods used<br /> in that system for that heading, sub-heading or chapter. For each entry in the first<br /> 73<br /> two columns the rules are specified in column 3. Where, in some cases, the entry<br /> in the first column is preceded by an \"ex\", this signifies that the rules in column 3<br /> apply only to the part of that heading or sub heading as described in column 2.<br /> 2.2 Where several heading or sub heading numbers are grouped together in column<br /> 1 or a chapter number is given and the description of products in column 2 is<br /> therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rules in column 3 apply to all<br /> products which, under the Harmonized System, are classified in headings of the<br /> chapter or in any of the headings grouped together in column 1.<br /> 2.3 Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a<br /> heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered<br /> by the adjacent rules in column 3.<br /> 2.4 Where, for an entry in the first two columns, more than one rule is specified in<br /> column 3, the exporter may opt, as an alternative, to apply either of the rules set<br /> out in column 3.<br /> Note 3: Examples of how the rules are applied<br /> 3.1 The provisions of rule 6 of these Rules concerning products having acquired<br /> originating status which are used in the manufacture of other products apply<br /> regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where these<br /> products are used or in another factory in the Partner States.<br /> 3.2 Pursuant to rule 7, the working or processing carried out must go beyond the list<br /> of operations mentioned in that rule. If it does not, the finished products shall not<br /> qualify for Community tariff treatment, even if the conditions set out in the list in<br /> Part 1 are met.<br /> 3.3 The rules in the list represent the minimum amount of working or processing<br /> required and the carrying out of more working or processing also confers<br /> originating status; conversely, the carrying out of less working or processing<br /> cannot confer originating status. Therefore, if a rule provides that non-originating<br /> material at a certain level of manufacture may be used, the use of such material at<br /> an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed and the use of such material at a later<br /> stage is not.<br /> 3.4 Without prejudice to Note 3.3 where a rule uses the expression \"Manufacture<br /> from materials of any heading\", then materials of any heading(s) (even materials<br /> of the same description and heading as the product) may also be used, subject,<br /> however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in the rule.<br /> 74<br /> However, the expression \"Manufacture from materials of any heading, including<br /> other materials of heading \u2026\" or \"Manufacture from materials of any heading,<br /> including other materials of the same heading as the product\" means that materials<br /> of any heading(s) may be used, except those of the same description as the<br /> product as given in column 2 of the list.<br /> 3.5 Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a<br /> particular material, the condition obviously does not prevent the use of other<br /> materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule.<br /> Note 4: General provisions concerning certain agricultural goods<br /> Agricultural goods falling within Chapters 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and heading 24.01<br /> which are harvested in the territory of a Partner State shall be treated as originating<br /> in the territory of that Partner State, even if grown from seeds, bulbs, rootstock,<br /> cuttings, grafts, shoots, buds, or other live parts of plants imported from a foreign<br /> country.<br /> Note 5: Terminology used for certain textile products<br /> 5.1 The term \"natural fibres\" is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or<br /> synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including<br /> waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres that have been carded,<br /> combed or otherwise processed but not spun.<br /> 5.2 The term \"natural fibres\" includes horsehair of heading 05.03, silk of heading<br /> 50.02 and 50.03 as well as the wool fibres, fine or coarse animal hair of heading<br /> 51.01 to 51.05, the cotton fibres of heading 52.01 to 52.03 and the other vegetable<br /> fibres of heading 53.01 to 53.05.<br /> 5.3 The term \"man-made staple fibres\" is used in the list to refer to synthetic or<br /> artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of heading 55.01 to 55.07.<br /> Note 6: Tolerances applicable to products made of a mixture of textile materials<br /> 6.1 Where for a given product in the list a reference is made to this note, the conditions<br /> set out in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials, used in the<br /> manufacture of this product, which, taken together, represent 10 per cent or less<br /> of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 6.3 and<br /> 6.4 below).<br /> 6.2 However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 6.1 may only be applied to mixed<br /> products which have been made from two or more basic textile materials.<br /> 75<br /> The following are the basic textile materials:<br /> (a) silk;<br /> (b) wool;<br /> (c) coarse animal hair;<br /> (d) fine animal hair;<br /> (e) horsehair;<br /> (f) cotton;<br /> (g) paper-making materials and paper;<br /> (h) flax;<br /> (i) true hemp;<br /> (j) jute and other textile bast fibres;<br /> (k) sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave;<br /> (l) coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres;<br /> (m) synthetic man-made filaments;<br /> (n) artificial man-made filaments;<br /> (o) current conducting filaments;<br /> (p) synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene;<br /> (q) synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester;<br /> (r) synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide;<br /> (s) synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile;<br /> (t) synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide;<br /> (u) synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene;<br /> (v) synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyphenylene sulphide;<br /> (w) synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyvinyl chloride;<br /> (x) other synthetic man-made staple fibres;<br /> 76<br /> (y) artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose;<br /> (z) other artificial man-made staple fibres;<br /> (aa) yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of<br /> polyether whether or not gimped;<br /> (bb) products of heading No 5605 (metallized yarn) incorporating strip<br /> consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film<br /> whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not<br /> exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured<br /> adhesive between two layers of plastic film;<br /> (cc) other products of heading 56.05;<br /> (dd) glass fibre;<br /> (ee) metal fibre.<br /> Example:<br /> A yarn of heading 52.05 made from cotton fibres of heading 52.03 and synthetic<br /> staple fibres of heading 55.06 is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic<br /> staple fibres that do not satisfy the origin rules may be used up to a weight of 10<br /> per cent of the yarn.<br /> Example:<br /> Tufted textile fabric of heading 58.02 made from cotton yarn of heading 52.05<br /> and cotton fabric of heading 52.10 is only a mixed product if the cotton fabric is<br /> itself a mixed fabric being made from yarns classified in two separate headings<br /> or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.<br /> Example:<br /> If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading<br /> 52.05 and synthetic fabric of heading 54.07, then, obviously, the yarns used are<br /> two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is accordingly a<br /> mixed product.<br /> 6.3 In the case of products incorporating \"yarn made of polyurethane segmented<br /> with flexible segments of polyether whether or not gimped\" this tolerance is 20<br /> per cent in respect of this yarn.<br /> 77<br /> 6.4 In the case of products incorporating \"strip consisting of a core of aluminium<br /> foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of<br /> a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of an adhesive between two<br /> layers of plastic film\", this tolerance is 30 per cent in respect of this strip.<br /> Note 7: Other tolerances applicable to certain textile products<br /> 7.1 Where, in the list reference is made to this Note, textile materials which do not<br /> satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the made up products concerned,<br /> may be used, provided that their weight does not exceed 10 % of the total weight<br /> of all the textile materials incorporated.<br /> 7.2 Materials which are not classified within Chapters 50 - 63, may be used freely in<br /> the manufacture of textile products, whether or not they contain textiles.<br /> 7.3 If a rule in the list says that for a particular textile item, such as a blouse, fabric<br /> must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons,<br /> because they cannot be made from textile materials.<br /> 7.4 Where a percentage rule applies, the value of materials which are not classified<br /> within Chapters 50 to 63 must be taken into account when calculating the value<br /> of the non-originating materials incorporated.<br /> Note 8: Specific processes and simple operations carried out in respect of certain<br /> products of Chapter 27<br /> 8.1 For the purposes of headings ex 27.07 and 27.13 the \"specific processes\" are the<br /> following:<br /> (a) vacuum distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;<br /> (c) cracking;<br /> (d) reforming;<br /> (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f) the process comprising all the following operations: processing with<br /> concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralization<br /> with alkaline agents; decolorization and purification with naturally active<br /> earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;<br /> 78<br /> (g) polymerization;<br /> (h) alkylation;<br /> (i) isomerization.<br /> 8.2 For the purposes of heading 27.10, 27.11 and 27.12, the \"specific processes\" are<br /> the following:<br /> (a) vacuum distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;<br /> (c) cracking;<br /> (d) reforming;<br /> (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f) the process comprising all the following operations: processing with<br /> concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralization<br /> with alkaline agents; decolourization and purification with naturally active<br /> earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;<br /> (g) polymerization;<br /> (h) alkylation;<br /> (i) isomerization;<br /> (j) in respect of heavy oils falling within heading ex 27.10 only, desulphurization<br /> with hydrogen resulting in a reduction of at least 85 per cent of the sulphur<br /> content of the products processed (ASTM D 1266-59 T method);<br /> (k) in respect of products falling within heading 27.10 only, deparaffining by a<br /> process other than filtering;<br /> (l) in respect of heavy oils falling within heading ex 27.10 only, treatment<br /> with hydrogen at a pressure of more than 20 bar and a temperature of more<br /> than 250\u00b0C with the use of a catalyst, other than to effect desulphurization,<br /> when the hydrogen constitutes an active element in a chemical reaction.<br /> The further treatment with hydrogen of lubricating oils of heading ex 27.10<br /> (e.g. hydro finishing or decolorization) in order, more especially, to improve<br /> colour or stability shall not, however, be deemed to be a specific process;<br /> (m) in respect of fuel oils falling within heading ex 27.10 only, atmospheric<br /> distillation, on condition that less than 30 per cent of these products distils,<br /> by volume, including losses, at 300\u00b0C by the ASTM D 86 method;<br /> 79<br /> (n) in respect of heavy oils other than gas oils and fuel oils falling within<br /> heading ex 27.10 only, treatment by means of a high-frequency electrical<br /> brush-discharge.<br /> 8.3 For the purposes of headings ex 27.07 and 27.13, simple operations such as<br /> cleaning, decanting, desalting, water separation, filtering, colouring, marking,<br /> obtaining a sulphur content as a result of mixing products with different sulphur<br /> contents, any combination of these operations or like operations do not confer<br /> origin.<br /> 8.4 Mixing and blending<br /> For the purposes of headings 27.07 and 27.10 to 27.15, the deliberate and<br /> proportionally controlled mixing or blending (including dispersing) of materials<br /> to conform to predetermined specifications which results in the production of a<br /> good having physical, chemical characteristics which are relevant to the purposes<br /> or uses of the good and are different from the input materials is to be considered<br /> origin conferring.<br

charges and expenses in<br /> paragraphs 2 and 3 shall be included plus the factory profit margin:<br /> 2 Materials:<br /> (a) The cost of non-originating materials, including the cost of waste materials<br /> and materials lost in the process of manufacture, as represented by landed<br /> cost of these materials at the factory, including any charges incidental to the<br /> delivery of such materials to the factory or if this is not known or cannot be<br /> ascertained, the first ascertainable price paid for them in the Partner State<br /> where they were used in a process of production;<br /> The following expenses, where included may be deducted:<br /> (i) the costs of freight, insurance, packing and all other costs incurred in<br /> transporting the materials to a Partner State or between the territories<br /> of two or more Partner States to the location of the producer;<br /> (ii) duties, taxes and customs brokerage fees on the material paid in the<br />

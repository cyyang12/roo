The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column gives the heading number or<br /> chapter number used in the Harmonised System and the second column gives the description of goods used in that<br /> system for that heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in column 3 or 4.<br /> Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an 'ex', this signifies that the rules in column 3 or<br /> 4 apply only to the part of that heading as described in column 2.<br /> 2.2. Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number is given and the description<br /> of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rules in column 3 or 4 apply to all<br /> products which, under the Harmonised System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in any of the headings<br /> grouped together in column 1.<br /> 2.3. Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each indent contains the<br /> description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rules in column 3 or 4.<br /> 2.4. Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns 3 and 4, the exporter may opt to<br /> apply either the rule set out in column 3 or that set out in column 4. If no origin rule is given in column 4, the rule<br /> set out in column 3 is to be applied.<br /> Note 3:<br /> 3.1. The provisions of Article 5 of this Appendix, concerning products having acquired originating status which are used<br /> in the manufacture of other products, shall apply regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the<br /> factory where these products are used or in another factory in a Contracting Party.<br /> Example:<br /> An engine of heading 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-originating materials which may be<br /> incorporated may not exceed 40 % of the ex-works price, is made from 'other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging'<br /> of heading ex 7224.<br /> If this forging has been forged in the European Union from a non-originating ingot, it has already acquired<br /> originating status by virtue of the rule for heading ex 7224 in the list. The forging can then count as originating<br /> in the value-calculation for the engine, regardless of whether it was produced in the same factory or in another<br /> factory in the European Union. The value of the non-originating ingot is thus not taken into account when adding<br /> up the value of the non-originating materials used.<br /> 3.2. The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing required, and the carrying-out of more<br /> working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the carrying-out of less working or processing<br /> cannot confer originating status. Thus, if a rule provides that non-originating material, at a certain level of manu-<br /> facture, may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed, and the use of such<br /> material at a later stage is not.<br /> 3.3. Without prejudice to Note 3.2, where a rule uses the expression 'Manufacture from materials of any heading', then<br /> materials of any heading(s) (even materials of the same description and heading as the product) may be used, subject,<br /> however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in the rule.<br /> However, the expression 'Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of heading ...' or<br /> 'Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of the same heading as the product' means<br /> that materials of any heading(s) may be used, except those of the same description as the product as given in column<br /> 2 of the list.<br /> 3.4. When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one material, this means that<br /> one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all be used.<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for fabrics of headings 5208 to 5212 provides that natural fibres may be used and that chemical materials,<br /> among other materials, may also be used. This does not mean that both have to be used; it is possible to use one or<br /> the other, or both.<br /> 3.5. Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular material, the condition does<br /> not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule. (See also Note<br /> 6.2 below in relation to textiles).<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for prepared foods of heading 1904, which specifically excludes the use of cereals and their derivatives, does<br /> not prevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and other additives which are not products from cereals.<br /> However, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be manufactured from the particular<br /> materials specified in the list, can be produced from a material of the same nature at an earlier stage of manufacture.<br /> Example:<br /> In the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 made from non-woven materials, if the use of only non-<br /> originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is not possible to start from non-woven cloth - even if non-<br /> woven cloths cannot normally be made from yarn. In such cases, the starting material would normally be at the<br /> stage before yarn - that is, the fibre stage.<br /> 3.6. Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of non-originating materials that can<br /> be used, then these percentages may not be added together. In other words, the maximum value of all the non-<br /> originating materials used may never exceed the higher of the percentages given. Furthermore, the individual<br /> percentages must not be exceeded, in relation to the particular materials to which they apply.<br /> Note 4:<br /> 4.1. The term 'natural fibres' is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic fibres. It is restricted to<br /> the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres which have<br /> been carded, combed or otherwise processed, but not spun.<br /> 4.2. The term 'natural fibres' includes horsehair of heading 0511, silk of headings 5002 and 5003, as well as wool fibres<br /> and fine or coarse animal hair of headings 5101 to 5105, cotton fibres of headings 5201 to 5203, and other<br /> vegetable fibres of headings 5301 to 5305.<br /> 4.3. The terms 'textile pulp', 'chemical materials' and 'paper-making materials' are used in the list to describe the materials,<br /> not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.<br /> 4.4. The term 'man-made staple fibres' is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament tow, staple fibres or<br /> waste, of headings 5501 to 5507.<br /> Note 5:<br /> 5.1. Where, for a given product in the list, reference is made to this Note, the conditions set out in column 3 shall not be<br /> applied to any basic textile materials used in the manufacture of this product and which, taken together, represent<br /> 10 % or less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 5.3 and 5.4).<br /> 5.2. However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 5.1 may be applied only to mixed products which have been made from<br /> two or more basic textile materials.<br /> The following are the basic textile materials:<br /> \u2014 silk,<br /> \u2014 wool,<br /> \u2014 coarse animal hair,<br /> \u2014 fine animal hair,<br /> \u2014 horsehair,<br /> \u2014 cotton,<br /> \u2014 paper-making materials and paper,<br /> \u2014 flax,<br /> \u2014 true hemp,<br /> \u2014 jute and other textile bast fibres,<br /> \u2014 sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave,<br /> \u2014 coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made filaments,<br /> \u2014 artificial man-made filaments,<br /> \u2014 current-conducting filaments,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(phenylene sulphide),<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(vinyl chloride),<br /> \u2014 other synthetic man-made staple fibres,<br /> \u2014 artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose,<br /> \u2014 other artificial man-made staple fibres,<br /> \u2014 yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped,<br /> \u2014 yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester, whether or not gimped,<br /> \u2014 products of heading 5605 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a<br /> core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched<br /> by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film,<br /> \u2014 other products of heading 5605.<br /> Example:<br /> A yarn, of heading 5205, made from cotton fibres of heading 5203 and synthetic staple fibres of heading 5506, is a<br /> mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres which do not satisfy the origin-rules (which require<br /> manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed<br /> 10 % of the weight of the yarn.<br /> Example:<br /> A woollen fabric, of heading 5112, made from woollen yarn of heading 5107 and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of<br /> heading 5509, is a mixed fabric. Therefore, synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the origin-rules (which require<br /> manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp), or woollen yarn which does not satisfy the origin-rules (which<br /> require manufacture from natural fibres, not carded or combed or otherwise prepared for spinning), or a<br /> combination of the two, may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10 % of the weight of<br /> the fabric.<br /> Example:<br /> Tufted textile fabric, of heading 5802, made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and cotton fabric of heading 5210,<br /> is a only mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric made from yarns classified in two separate<br /> headings, or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.<br /> Example:<br /> If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and synthetic fabric of<br /> heading 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is,<br /> accordingly, a mixed product.<br /> 5.3. In the case of products incorporating 'yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether,<br /> whether or not gimped', this tolerance is 20 % in respect of this yarn.<br /> 5.4. In the case of products incorporating 'strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether<br /> or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or<br /> coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film', this tolerance is 30 % in respect of this strip.<br /> Note 6:<br /> 6.1. Where, in the list, reference is made to this Note, textile materials (with the exception of linings and interlinings),<br /> which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the made-up product concerned, may be used,<br /> provided that they are classified in a heading other than that of the product and that their value does not exceed 8 %<br /> of the ex-works price of the product.<br /> 6.2. Without prejudice to Note 6.3, materials, which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63, may be used freely in<br /> the manufacture of textile products, whether or not they contain textiles.<br /> Example:<br /> If a rule in the list provides that, for a particular textile item (such as trousers), yarn must be used, this does not<br /> prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because buttons are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63. For the<br /> same reason, it does not prevent the use of slide-fasteners, even though slide-fasteners normally contain textiles.<br /> 6.3. Where a percentage rule applies, the value of materials which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63 must be<br /> taken into account when calculating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.<br /> Note 7:<br /> 7.1. For the purposes of headings ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex 3403, the 'specific processes' are the<br /> following:<br /> (a) vacuum-distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;<br /> (c) cracking;<br /> (d) reforming;<br /> (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f) the process comprising all of the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or<br /> sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification with naturally active<br /> earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;<br /> (g) polymerisation;<br /> (h) alkylation;<br /> (i) isomerisation.<br /> 7.2. For the purposes of headings 2710, 2711 and 2712, the 'specific processes' are the following:<br /> (a) vacuum-distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;<br /> (c) cracking;<br /> (d) reforming;<br /> (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f) the process comprising all of the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or<br /> sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification with naturally active<br /> earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;<br /> (g) polymerisation;<br /> (h) alkylation;<br /> (i) isomerisation;<br /> (j) in respect of heavy oils of heading ex 2710 only, desulphurisation with hydrogen, resulting in a reduction of at<br /> least 85 % of the sulphur content of the products processed (ASTM D 1266-59 T method);<br /> (k) in respect of products of heading 2710 only, deparaffining by a process other than filtering;<br /> (l) in respect of heavy oils of heading ex 2710 only, treatment with hydrogen, at a pressure of more than 20 bar<br /> and a temperature of more than 250 \u00b0C, with the use of a catalyst, other than to effect desulphurisation, when<br /> the hydrogen constitutes an active element in a chemical reaction. The further treatment, with hydrogen, of<br /> lubricating oils of heading ex 2710 (e.g. hydrofinishing or decolourisation), in order, more especially, to improve<br /> colour or stability shall not, however, be deemed to be a specific process;<br /> (m) in respect of fuel oils of heading ex 2710 only, atmospheric distillation, on condition that less than 30 % of<br /> these products distils, by volume, including losses, at 300 \u00b0C, by the ASTM D 86 method;<br /> (n) in respect of heavy oils other than gas oils and fuel oils of heading ex 2710 only, treatment by means of a high-<br /> frequency electrical brush discharge;<br /> (o) in respect of crude products (other than petroleum jelly, ozokerite, lignite wax or peat wax, paraffin wax<br /> containing by weight less than 0.75 % of oil) of heading ex 2712 only, de-oiling by fractional crystallisation.<br /> 7.3. For the purposes of headings ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex 3403, simple operations, such as<br /> cleaning, decanting, desalting, water separation, filtering, colouring, marking, obtaining a sulphur content as a result<br /> of mixing products with different sulphur contents, or any combination of these operations or like operations, do<br /> not confer origin.", "ShowProductAffected": false, "ProductAffected": null, "RevisionName": null, "Rank": 0, "ShowRooExceptions": false, "RooExceptions": null}], "SpecificNote": [{"RooCode": null, "RooText": null, "ShowProductAffected": false, "ProductAffected": null, "RevisionName": null, "Rank": 0, "ShowRooExceptions": false, "RooExceptions": null}], "Documents": [{"DocDesc": "Certificate of origin", "DocFileName": "itc00791_coo.pdf", "DocType": "1_coo", "WebLink": null}, {"DocDesc": "Product-specific rules of origin", "DocFileName": "itc00791_sroo.pdf", "DocType": "2_sroo", "WebLink": null}, {"DocDesc": "Chapter on rules of origin", "DocFileName": "itc00791_roo.pdf", "DocType": "3_roo", "WebLink": "https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:L:2013:054:FULL&from=EN"}, {"DocDesc": "WTO notification", "DocFileName": "itc00791_wto.pdf", "DocType": "9_wto", "WebLink": "https://docs.wto.org/dol2fe/Pages/SS/directdoc.aspx?filename=q:/G/RO/N166.pdf"}]}, "FtaProvisions": {"RooProvision": [{"ProvisionAbbrev": "accum", "ProvisionCode": "Cumulation", "ProvisionValue": "cross-cumulation", "ProvisionRank": null, "ProvisionGlossary": "A provision which allows to consider goods obtained in as well as processing taking place in one FTA member country as originating in another.", "ProvisionGlossaryLink": "/en/glossary?uid=accum&returnto=gloscenter", "ProvisionLegalExtract": "Article 3 : Cumulation of origin <br /> 1 Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 2(1), products shall be considered as originating in the exporting <br /> Contracting Party when exported to another Contracting Party if they are obtained there, incorporating materials <br /> originating in Switzerland (including Liechtenstein) (1), Iceland, Norway, Turkey or in the European Union, provided <br /> that the working or processing carried out in the exporting Contracting Party goes beyond the operations referred to <br /> in Article 6.

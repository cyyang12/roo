Accordingly, it follows that if an<br /> originating product is used in the manufacture of another product, the rules set out<br /> in Column C applicable to the product in which it is incorporated do not apply to it,<br /> and no account shall be taken of the non-originating materials, which have been<br /> used in its manufacture.<br /> 3.3 References to HS code number in Column A in Part II are references as they appear<br /> in the Harmonized System, as amended and in force.

Column A gives the<br /> heading used in the HS and Column B gives the description of goods used in that<br /> system for that heading or Chapter. For each entry in Columns A and B, a rule is<br /> specified in Column C.<br /> 3.5 Where a Chapter number is given in Column A, and the description of goods in<br /> Column B is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rules in Column C apply<br /> to all products which, under the HS are classified in headings of the Chapter.<br /> 3.6 Where the entry in the first column is preceded by an \"ex\", this signifies that the<br /> rules in Column C apply only to that part of that heading as described in Column A.<br /> Note 4<br /> 4.1 The rules specified in Column C represent the minimum amount of working or<br /> processing required and the carrying out of more working or processing also confers<br /> originating status; conversely, the carrying out of less working or processing cannot<br /> confer originating status.<br /> 4.2 Where a rule in Column C specifies that a product must be manufactured from a<br /> particular material, the rule obviously does not prevent the use of other materials,<br /> which because of their inherent nature cannot satisfy the rule.<br /> PART 1: PROTOCOL ON THE RULES OF ORIGIN<br /> APPENDIX<br /> APPENDIX<br /> Example 1:<br /> The rule for prepared foods of heading 19.04, which specifically excludes the use of cereals<br /> and their derivatives, does not prevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and other<br /> additives, which are not products from cereals.<br /> Example 2:<br /> If a rule in Column C says that for a particular textile item, yarn must be used, this does not<br /> prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because they cannot be made from textile<br /> materials.<br /> However, this does not apply to products, which, although they can be manufactured from<br /> the particular materials specified in Column C can be produced from a material of the same<br /> nature at an earlier stage of manufacture.<br /> Example:<br /> In the case of an article of apparel of Chapter 62 made from non-woven materials, if the<br /> use of only non-originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is not possible to start<br /> from non-woven cloth, even if non-woven cloths cannot normally be made from yarn.

It is important that the process of issuing <br /> the certificates be reliable and predictable at this will assist exporters in planning for their exports. <br /> 3.3.2 Proof of Origin <br /> Goods that have been accepted as meeting all the requirements of the Rules of Origin are <br /> entitled to a COMESA Certificate of Origin, a specimen of which appears at Annex I. <br /> The Certificate is issued by the Designated Issuing Authority in the exporting Member State. [A <br /> list of Member States' Designated Authorities is provided at Annex II] <br /> The certificate of origin should be attached to the import goods declaration to enable the <br /> Customs authorities of the importing member State to grant preferential <br /> tariff treatment to the shipment. <br /> Article 3.4 : What an exporter should do to obtain a certificate of origin <br /> 3.4.1. An exporter in a COMESA member State intending to export goods to another member <br /> State and desiring to have such goods granted preferential tariff treatment in the <br /> importing Member State must obtain a certificate of origin from the authority in his State <br /> who has been designated to issue such certificates. <br /> The certificate, when presented by the importer to the Customs Authorities in the <br /> importing member State will serve as evidence of their originating status and hence <br /> enable them to be accorded preferential tariff treatment that is being sought. <br /> 3.4.2 An exporter who has been registered by the Designated Issuing Authority of a member <br /> State should do the following: <br /> (i) Ensure that the product(s) for which he is seeking a certificate have been <br /> approved, as per his letter of approval. <br /> (ii) Complete a certificate of Origin for each shipment based on his letter of approval <br /> issued by the Designated Issuing Authority. <br /> (iii) Quote his registration number in the appropriate box of the certificate. <br /> (iv) Attach the certificate of origin to the export bill of entry. <br /> (v) The export declaration, together with the certificate of origin and other <br /> supporting documents should be submitted to the Designated Issuing Authority <br /> for authorisation of the export. <br /> Article 3.5 : The COMESA Certificate of Origin <br /> 3.5.1 Who can fill it in? <br /> The exporter should complete the certificate, as he is the person who has the facts about the <br /> originating status of the goods to be exported. <br /> 3.5.2 Completion of the Certificate of Origin form <br /> The exporter must enter all the information required in boxes 1 to 11 on the form of the <br /> certificate, except Box 5, which is reserved for official use. <br /> The form may be prepared by any process, provided the entries are indelible and legible. Neither <br /> erasures nor super-impositions are allowed on the form, and any alterations must be made by <br /> striking out the erroneous entries and thereafter making or inserting any required additions. Any <br /> such alterations must be initialed by the person who completed the form and endorsed by the <br /> authority designated to issue the certificate. <br /> Any unused spaces on the form should be crossed out in such a manner as to prevent any <br /> subsequent addition. <br /> Box 1: Exporter <br /> Details of the registered exporter, who is a registered company operating in the member State <br /> must be entered in this box. <br /> Box 2: Consignee <br /> Details of the consignee in the importing member State must be entered in this box. <br /> Box 3: Country, Group of countries in which the products are considered as originating <br /> The member State(s) where the goods acquired their originating status must be entered in this <br /> box. <br /> Box 4: Particulars of Transport <br /> Details of transport used to ferry the goods from the exporting Member State to the importing <br /> member State must be entered in this box. For example: truck registration number: AAA 0001. <br /> Box 5: For Official use <br /> The Designated Issuing Authority can use this box to enter any pertinent information regarding <br /> the export shipment. E.g. where COMESA originating goods are re-shipped from one Member <br /> State to another, the reference number of the Certificate of origin issued by the first exporting <br /> Member State can be entered in this box. <br /> Box 6: Marks and numbers; number and kind of package; description of goods. <br /> Marks and numbers: <br /> Any identifying marks and numbers of the packages should be entered in this box. <br /> If the goods are not numbered in any way, the words \"No marks and numbers\" should be entered. <br /> Number and kind of package: <br /> This refers to, for example, boxes, drums, bags, e.t.c. <br /> For goods in bulk, the words \"in bulk\" should be entered. <br /> Description of goods: <br /> Goods must be described in accordance with commercial practice and with sufficient detail to <br /> enable them to be identified. <br /> Box 7: Customs Tariff <br /> The tariff code as per the Member State's national tariff schedule must be entered in this box. <br /> Box 8: Origin Criterion <br /> The specific qualifying criterion under Rule 2 of the Protocol on Rules of Origin must be entered <br /> in this box. For this purpose, the following letters should be used against each item entered in <br /> the certificate, as appropriate. <br /> \"P\" - for goods wholly produced; <br /> \"M\" - for goods to which material content criterion applies; <br /> \"V\" - for goods to which the value added criterion applies; <br /> \"X\" - for goods which are classified or become classifiable under a heading other than <br /> that under which the imported materials used in its manufacture fall; and <br /> \"Y\" - for goods of particular economic importance to the Member State. <br /> Box 9: Gross weight or other quantity <br /> It is recommended that exporters give weights and other measures in metric system. <br /> Box 10: Invoice no. <br /> State the number(s) and date(s) of the invoice(s) relating to the goods described in box 6. <br /> Box 11: Declaration by Exporter/Producer/Supplier <br /> Before signing the Declaration, the Exporter should ensure that all the particulars entered by <br /> him in the form are correct. <br /> While the exporter is free to decide who will sign declarations on his behalf, it is recommended <br /> that the person so authorized be a member of the exporting firm. <br /> Declarations signed by shipping or forwarding agents and the like are not acceptable. <br /> The signature must not be mechanically reproduced or made with a rubber stamp, as by signing <br /> the form, the exporter declares that the goods described in Box 6 qualify as COMESA originating <br /> products. If this declaration is incorrect, the exporter would have committed can offence under <br /> Customs law. <br /> Box 12: Certificate of Origin <br /> This box should be filled in by the Designated Issuing Authority of the exporting member State. <br /> The Authority should endorse its origin verification stamp in this box in the appropriate space. <br /> The impression of the stamp should be very clear to avoid raising doubt by authorities of the <br /> importing Member State as to its authenticity. <br /> Article 3.6 : Procedures for processing the COMESA Certificates of Origin <br /> 3.6.1 The declaration furnished by an exporter claiming that the goods being exported by <br /> him are eligible for preferential tariff treatment must be authenticated by the authority <br /> designated by the exporting Member State, if the goods are to be accepted by the <br /> importing member State as originating in a COMESA member State. <br /> Before such authentication (by stamping and signing the certificate) the authority should satisfy <br /> itself that the requirements of the Rules of Origin applicable to the goods for which preferential <br /> tariff treatment is being claimed have been complied with. <br /> 3.6.2 The Designated Issuing Authority will process the certificate as follows: <br /> (i) Ensure that the Certificate of Origin form has been completed in triplicate; <br /> (ii) Ensure that the form is completely and correctly filled out; <br /> (iii) Confirm that product meets the requirements of the COMESA Rules of Origin; <br /> (iv) Confirm that the exporter's registration number has been entered in the <br /> appropriate box, i.e. on the top right hand corner of the certificate in the space \"Ref. No\u2026\" <br /> (v) Compare the particulars entered in the certificate with those in the commercial <br /> invoice; <br /> (vi) If everything is in order, enter country of origin, stamp and sign the certificate in <br /> box 12. <br /> (vii) The stamp to be used is the one whose impression has been circulated to other <br /> COMESA member States. Similarly, the official signing the certificate should have <br /> had his name and signature circulated to other member States. <br /> NOTE: After the Designated Issuing Authority has signed and issued the certificate, no other body <br /> should endorse it. <br /> 3.6 3 Distribution of the Certificate of Origin <br /> Once the certificate of origin has been certified, it should be distributed as follows: <br /> Original copy <br /> This copy should be returned to the exporter for onward transmission to the importer in the <br /> importing Member State to which the goods are consigned to enable the importer to complete <br /> the necessary documents for entry of the goods. <br /> Duplicate copy <br /> This copy should be retained by the Designated Issuing Authority. <br /> Triplicate copy <br /> This copy should be returned to the exporter for his records. <br /> Article 3.13 : Special Regime for small-scale traders <br /> 3.13.1 Introduction <br /> Small-scale traders play an important role to the economic and social development of member <br /> States. For a long time, this sector has not been benefiting from preferential tariffs offered <br /> under the COMESA trade regime and COMESA members have since put in place measures that <br /> will allow the sector to benefit from preferential tariff treatment. COMESA members agreed to <br /> facilitate small-scale border traders who import originating goods of a commercial nature valued <br /> at an agreed threshold to benefit from preferential tariffs through the use of a simplified form of <br /> certificate of origin and a simplified Customs declaration form. <br /> 3.13.2 Common list of approved products <br /> Member States with common borders should agree on a list of originating goods that are <br /> commonly traded by the small-scale border traders. <br /> The goods can either be \"wholly produced\" or manufactured in the Member States. <br /> Originating goods manufactured in the Member States should have been produced by a <br /> manufacturer who is a registered exporter. The registration number of the registered exporter <br /> should be shown against each manufactured product that is listed. <br /> The common list of products should be distributed to all offices of the Designated Issuing <br /> Authorities of the concerned Member States who will use this information to authenticate the <br /> simplified certificate of origin. <br /> The list should also be distributed to the Customs Authorities of the concerned member States <br /> to facilitate the granting of preferential tariff treatment when goods appearing on the list are <br /> imported into the respective member States. <br /> Sample of Common List HS Code <br /> Product 0101 to 0106 <br /> Live animals 0701 <br /> Potatoes, fresh or chilled 0702 <br /> Tomatoes, fresh or chilled 0703 <br /> Onions, shallots, garlic, leeks 0704 <br /> Cabbages, cauliflowers, etc. 0705 <br /> Lettuce <br /> 3.13.3 Issuance of the COMESA Simplified Certificate of Origin <br /> A small-scale border trader whose consignment qualifies should complete the COMESA <br /> Simplified Certificate of Origin and the Simplified COMESA Customs Document, provided at <br /> Annex VI, attach his invoice and present these documents to the Designated Issuing Authority <br /> for authentication. <br /> The Designated issuing Authority should confirm that the goods qualify for the simplified <br /> procedures. If satisfied, the Authority should endorse its reference number on the certificate, <br /> stamp and sign it. <br /> The certified Simplified Certificate of Origin will entitle the goods to preferential tariff treatment <br /> in the importing Member State. <br /> Since by virtue of being included on the Common List it is assumed that the products originate <br /> from the Member States in question, it may not be necessary to require a certificate of origin <br /> before granting preferential tariff treatment. <br /> 3.13.4 What Customs Authorities in the importing member State should do <br /> The Customs Authorities will: <br /> (i) Check that the goods declared by the trader on the simplified Certificate of Origin <br /> appear on the common list of approved products. <br /> (ii) Confirm that the signature and stamp appearing on the certificate are the same as <br /> those notified by the Designated Issuing Authority of the exporting Member State <br /> or the Customs Officer processing the transaction can sign the certificate at the border. <br /> (iii) If everything is in order, the goods will be entitled to preferential tariff treatment <br /> in the importing Member State.", "ProvisionValueCssClass": "", "ProvisionDisplayCssClass": null}, {"ProvisionAbbrev": "exmptcoo", "ProvisionCode": "Exemption of certification", "ProvisionValue": "not included", "ProvisionRank": null, "ProvisionGlossary": "A provision which lists exemptions from the requirement to provide a proof of origin.

This is often the government or a government department which can then delegate the procedure of issuing certificates to other domestic organisations.", "ProvisionGlossaryLink": "/en/glossary?uid=comp&returnto=gloscenter", "ProvisionLegalExtract": "Article 3.8 : Collaboration with Customs and other Authorities <br /> Where the responsibility for certifying COMESA certificates of origin is vested in an agency other <br /> than the Customs Authorities, an effective collaborative relationship between the two bodies <br /> should be developed for the effective performance of the certification and verification function. <br /> The certifying authority should also co-operate with other agencies, which can provide <br /> information, which may assist the authority to effectively carry out its mandate. <br /> Article 4.3 : Competences of the Designated Issuing Authority: <br /> The issuance of the COMESA Certificate of Origin by designated authorities demands that they <br /> are competent to implement all the provisions of the protocol on Rules of Origin. In particular, <br /> the designated authority must have competency in the following areas: <br /> (i) The Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (Harmonised System or HS) <br /> The HS has been designed to be the international standard commodity classification system <br /> for international trade. Developed as a multipurpose nomenclature, it is used by almost all <br /> COMESA countries as a basis for customs tariffs and international trade statistics, areas of <br /> customs controls and procedures, and rules of origin. The HS is also an important instrument <br /> in facilitating regional trade. This also means that, for origin determining purposes, designated <br /> authorities should be competent in the use of the HS for goods classification. This is an important <br /> condition of origin determination as the absence of common understanding of the classification <br /> rules of the HS can lead to problems in the determination of origin. In fact, all Member States <br /> should take necessary measures to ensure that the most recent version of the HS is applied in <br /> their Customs Administrations. The personnel of the designated authorities should therefore <br /> have adequate expertise in the HS classification rules and classification of goods. <br /> (ii) Customs Valuation of Goods and the WTO Valuation Agreement <br /> The WTO Valuation Agreement establishes a Customs valuation system that primarily bases the <br /> Customs value on the transaction value of the imported goods when sold for export to the <br /> country of importation. The Customs value of imported goods is determined mainly for the <br /> purposes of applying customs duties and constitutes the taxable basis for application of taxes <br /> levied at importation as well as internal taxes. Rule 2 (b) of the Protocol makes it necessary <br /> to understand Customs valuation of goods to determine the portion of imported materials <br /> used in the production of goods and the determination of value added. Similar to the expertise <br /> required for classification of goods along the HS, personnel of designated authorities should be <br /> adequately trained in customs valuation of goods. <br /> (iii) Technical Information on Manufacturing Processes <br /> \u00b7 A large amount of information is required for the implementation of <br /> the Protocol on Rules of Origin. Customs officials and other officials of <br /> designated authorities as well as economic operators need to know the <br /> principles and rules of the Protocol and how they work. <br /> \u00b7 They need to know where the information required for origin determination <br /> of goods can be found. Generally, the economic operator will provide the <br /> information but officials also need to have knowledge of materials used, <br /> of finished goods as well as the manufacturing processes. This information <br /> needs to be consolidated and used as a basis to effect controls in the <br /> manufacturing enterprises. <br /> \u00b7 The designated authority should also be empowered to call for any additional supporting <br /> evidence like the import declaration relating to the imported foreign materials utilised in the <br /> production process. This technical information so collected is used to verify if manufacturers <br /> meet the requirements of the Protocol to be eligible exporters under the COMESA regime and is <br /> used for annual or other periodical checks of exporting companies. <br /> (iv) Investigation and Control of Export Products <br /> \u00b7 Designated Authorities must have the legal authority to call for any <br /> document relating to the export of COMESA products. They should also <br /> have the legal power to carry out inspection of goods as well as the records <br /> and accounts of the exporter to verify the claim that goods shall be accepted <br /> as originating in accordance with the provisions of the Protocol. At time <br /> of export, they must check the contents and authenticity of supporting <br /> documents accompanying the Certificate of Origin. <br /> \u00b7 In cases of origin verification and other anomalies detected in the origin <br /> declared, the designated authorities must have the authority to request for <br /> information and exchange of information. <br /> \u00b7 The designated authority must also be empowered to establish offences of <br /> COMESA origin fraud and pursue legal action. <br /> National legal provisions relating to offences and penalties vary considerably from one Member <br /> State to another. However, the law in all member States must have adequate penalties in case <br /> of serious irregularities or falsification of the originating status of goods in order to discourage <br /> such practices by traders. <br /> (v) Accounting knowledge <br /> Officials of the designated authority should have basic Accounting knowledge, which is necessary <br /> for the application of Rule 2.1(b)(i) and (ii) of the Protocol on Rules of Origin. Officials of the <br /> designated issuing authority will be required to verify the eligibility of products to COMESA <br /> origin. The application of both the material and value added criteria require the officials to be <br /> conversant with basic principles of Accounting so that they are able to distinguish those cost <br /> elements that should form part of the imported material content or value added. For example, <br /> as far as materials used in production are concerned, one is supposed to be able to distinguish <br /> between direct and indirect materials. In the determination of value added, one is required to <br /> know, for example, the way manufacturing overheads are allocated to different products. <br /> It is therefore important for the officials of designated issuing authorities to have accounting <br /> knowledge, as it is useful in determining the eligibility of manufactured products to COMESA origin. <br /> (vi) Technical Knowledge of the Protocol on Rules of Origin <br /> They should have adequate technical working knowledge of the principles and rules of the <br /> Protocol on Rules of Origin. <br /> COMESA rules of origin are the cornerstone of the COMESA trade regime, and officials of <br /> designated issuing authority should have a good understanding of the application of the rules <br /> and principles of the Protocol. These officials will be required to, among other things, give advice <br /> to traders regarding the practical application of the various aspects of the Protocol, and hence <br /> they can only do so if they have adequate knowledge of the Protocol. <br /> (vii) Co-operation with other agencies <br /> The designated authority should co-operate with other agencies that may render assistance in <br /> the implementation of the Protocol on Rules of Origin. Such agencies include, among others, <br /> Registrars of companies, Export Processing Zones Authorities, Trade Promotion Bodies, Clearing <br /> Agents Associations and Importers and Exporters Associations.", "ProvisionValueCssClass": "", "ProvisionDisplayCssClass": null}, {"ProvisionAbbrev": "valid", "ProvisionCode": "Period of validity", "ProvisionValue": "not provided", "ProvisionRank": null, "ProvisionGlossary": "A provision that specifies the length of time an origin certificate or an origin declaration (see proof of origin) is valid for from the moment it has been issued.", "ProvisionGlossaryLink": "/en/glossary?uid=valid&returnto=gloscenter", "ProvisionLegalExtract": "", "ProvisionValueCssClass": "red", "ProvisionDisplayCssClass": null}, {"ProvisionAbbrev": "retention", "ProvisionCode": "Retention period", "ProvisionValue": "5 years", "ProvisionRank": null, "ProvisionGlossary": "A provision that specifies who (exporter, producer who issued a supplier declaration, importer, issuing or accepting customs authority) and for what period of time needs to retain the proof of origin.", "ProvisionGlossaryLink": "/en/glossary?uid=retention&returnto=gloscenter", "ProvisionLegalExtract": "Article 3.7 : Retention of documents <br /> 3.7.1 Registered exporters should be under legal obligation to keep adequate records of their <br /> activities.

In his application, the exporter will also attach a copy of the <br /> export declaration of the products to which the Certificate relates. A Certificate of <br /> Origin will be issued retrospectively if an application is made within three months <br /> from the date of exportation of the products.

Foreign markings on <br /> the goods or other physical evidence (e.g. operating instructions in a foreign language) should <br /> not be overlooked in the customs examination as this may point to the need for further enquiry <br /> into the claim to COMESA tariff treatment. <br /> (ii) More serious queries <br /> Where serious doubts arise about the eligibility of any consignment of goods for COMESA tariff <br /> treatment (e.g. claim of \"wholly produced\" for certain kinds of machinery, description of goods <br /> on the invoice different from that appearing in the certificate of origin, indication of dubious <br /> transport route, etc), a formal query of the evidence of origin presented may be communicated <br /> to the designated issuing authority of the exporting member State. <br /> The procedures governing the raising of queries and the subsequent verification of the evidence <br /> of origin is discussed in the next section of this manual. <br /> (iii) Verification Procedures <br /> (a) Need for verification <br /> Subsequent verifications of COMESA Certificate of Origin should be carried out at <br /> random or whenever the customs authorities of the importing Member State have <br /> reasonable doubts as to the authenticity of the document or as to the accuracy of <br /> the information regarding the originating status of the goods concerned. <br /> A separate form, a specimen of which is provided at Annex V shall be used for this <br /> purpose. <br /> (b) What the customs authorities of the importing member State should do when <br /> requesting for further supporting evidence <br /> (i) Where the customs authorities of the importing Member State are in doubt <br /> about the correctness of the evidence furnished to them by the importer, <br /> they may request the submission of further supporting evidence. <br /> (ii) When requesting for further supporting evidence, the customs authorities <br /> of the importing Member State should complete the Form for Verification <br /> of Origin, provided at Annex V. <br /> (iii) Any documents and information obtained suggesting that the information <br /> given in the certificate of origin is incorrect should be attached to the form <br /> and forwarded to the designated authority of the exporting member State <br /> in support of the request for verification. <br /> (iv) Requests for verification should be sent to the Designated Authority of <br /> the exporting Member State within 48 hours of the raising of the query of <br /> COMESA origin status. A copy of the \"query\" form should at the same time <br /> be given to the importer. <br /> (v) Where additional information is required, the customs authorities should <br /> clearly specify the nature of the additional information required to resolve <br /> the query. <br /> (vi) Requests for additional information should be made using the form <br /> provided at Annex VI, which is in four parts, A to D. <br /> (vii) The customs authorities requesting additional information should complete <br /> Part A of the form <br /> (iv) Release of goods which are subject to origin verification <br /> Where the customs authorities of the importing Member State decide to suspend the granting <br /> of preferential tariff treatment to the goods concerned while awaiting the results of the <br /> verification, the importer should be allowed delivery of the goods, provided adequate security <br /> has been given for any duty that might be found payable. The security given should be enough <br /> to cover the duty at stake only. <br /> However, delivery may be withheld, where goods are subject to any prohibitions. <br /> (v) What an importer should do if the customs authorities fail to activate the verification process <br /> Where the customs authorities in an importing member State refuse clearance of any <br /> consignment of goods but fail to activate the query/verification procedure, the importer of the <br /> goods should contact the Ministry or agency within his government responsible for COMESA <br /> matters, and at the same time advising the COMESA Secretariat. <br /> The importer should provide full details of the consignment: <br /> a. nature of the goods; <br /> b. number and kind of packages; <br /> c. value; <br /> d. country of origin and exportation; <br /> e. name and address of exporter; and <br /> f. transport details. <br /> The importer should also indicate the reason for refusal of release of the goods. <br /> (vi) What the Designated Issuing Authority in the exporting member State <br /> should do upon receipt of origin verification requests <br /> (a) Where no additional information is requested <br /> Upon receipt of the Form for Verification of Origin, the authority should immediately carry out <br /> investigations and communicate its findings to the importing Member State. <br /> The designated authority should complete Part B, \"RESULTS OF VERIFICATION\", fill in the <br /> appropriate box as to the originating status of the goods under consideration, stamp and sign <br /> the form. <br /> (b) Where additional information is requested <br /> Upon receipt of the request for additional information, the designated authority should: <br /> (i) Call upon the exporter to furnish information required in Part B of the request form. <br /> (ii) Only the relevant sections of Part B need be completed depending on the <br /> particular origin criterion in Rule 2.1 under which COMESA origin status is claimed. <br /> (iii) Ensure that the exporter has signed the Declaration in Part C of the form. <br /> (iv) To facilitate the checking of the additional information provided in Part B <br /> against the particulars of the goods covered by the certificate of origin under <br /> query, the total quantity or the quantity of the goods to which the detailed <br /> manufacturing costs being supplied are related, and the period when the <br /> manufacture took place should be stated in the response to the query. <br /> (v) If the authority is satisfied that the form has been properly completed and <br /> signed by the exporter, the authority should stamp and sign the certificate in <br /> Part D, and return the completed form promptly to the customs authorities <br /> of the importing Member State. <br /> (vi) Verification results <br /> Verification results should be forwarded to the authorities of the importing Member State as <br /> soon as possible, but not later than twelve weeks. In the case of difficulties of verification, the <br /> exporting Member State should notify authorities of the importing Member State that the <br /> enquiry is on-going and the results will be forwarded to them in due course. However, if no <br /> response is received within the twelve weeks, the COMESA Secretariat should be notified. <br /> If the further check in the exporting Member State establishes that the goods do not meet the <br /> requirements of the COMESA Rules of Origin for them to be accepted as originating in a Member <br /> State, the verification form should be returned to the importing Member State under cover of <br /> a confidential note explaining the results of the further check and indicating what action, if any <br /> is proposed against the exporter. In such a case, preferential tariff treatment is denied by the <br /> importing Member State. <br /> (vii) What to do if doubts persist about the originating status of goods <br /> Normally, the raising of a query by an importing member State and the provision of a response <br /> verifying the evidence of origin should dispose of the matter, either confirming or rejecting the <br /> claim of COMESA origin. <br /> (viii) Joint-on-the-spot investigation <br /> Where despite the response to a query by an exporting member State affirming the original <br /> claim of COMESA origin, doubts persist in the minds of the customs authorities in the importing <br /> Member State about the validity of the claim, prompt steps should be taken to resolve the matter. <br /> At the initiative of either the importing or the exporting Member State, arrangements should be <br /> made with the minimum of delay for representatives from both sides to meet in the Member <br /> State where production is carried out to examine together \"on-the-spot\" evidence on which the <br /> claim of COMESA originating status is based. <br /> (ix) What the customs authorities of the importing Member State and the <br /> Designated Issuing Authority of the exporting Member State should do. <br /> The two parties should do the following, among others, before carrying out the joint investigation: <br /> \u00b7 Agree on the dates on which to carry out the joint investigation. <br /> \u00b7 The customs authorities of the importing Member State should provide the <br /> Designated Issuing Authority in the exporting Member State with the names of <br /> the officials who will participate in the investigation so that it can arrange for <br /> their transport and accommodation in the exporting Member State. However, the <br /> visiting delegation should meet its accommodation expenses. <br /> \u00b7 The Designated Issuing Authority should assist the visiting delegation with visas <br /> and any other travel requirements. <br /> \u00b7 The Designated Issuing Authority should also ensure that the visiting delegation <br /> has access to its records pertaining to the registered exporter who is to be investigated. <br /> \u00b7 Depending on the origin criterion that is applicable to the goods under investigation <br /> and the nature of the production process involved, the two authorities may agree <br /> to co-opt independent technical experts to assist in the investigations. The two <br /> authorities will share any costs incurred in co-opting the experts. <br /> (x) Preparing for the visit to an exporter's premises <br /> It is advisable for the registered exporter to be informed of the intended visit. Mutual co- <br /> operation and consultation between the Designated Issuing Authority and registered exporter is <br /> important for successful verification to be carried out. <br /> Before leaving for the visit, the investigating officials should: <br /> (a) Note any specific points requiring investigation. <br /> (b) Study the bills of entry and supporting documents carefully, noting any features <br /> that may require further enquiry. <br /> (c) Obtain the following information regarding the registered exporter:- <br /> \u00b7 past history of exportation <br /> \u00b7 Origin Rulings related to the registered exporter and the goods <br /> \u00b7 previous visit reports (if any) concerning the registered exporter <br /> \u00b7 information from other sources, e.g. Customs Investigations <br /> \u00b7 any other relevant information. <br /> (xi) Report of visit <br /> The investigating officials should write a report after concluding the investigation. <br /> The report of visit may include the following items: <br /> \u00b7 Date(s) of visit <br /> \u00b7 Name and position in company of person(s) seen. <br /> \u00b7 Registered exporter's function, e.g. distributor. <br /> \u00b7 Confirmation that the signature in box 11 of the Certificate of Origin was made by <br /> an officer or authorized representative of the company investigated, and that the <br /> signatory was in full possession of the facts and entitled to sign the certificate. <br /> \u00b7 Principal countries to which the goods are exported. <br /> \u00b7 Main types of goods imported by the registered exporter, e.g. raw materials, <br /> finished goods, etc. <br /> \u00b7 Purposes for which the goods are imported, e.g. own use, further manufacture, <br /> resale as imported <br /> \u00b7 Details of procedures undertaken in auditing records and documents, whether <br /> held in computer or not. <br /> \u00b7 Details of any irregularities found in the course of the investigation. <br /> \u00b7 Any specific action taken against the registered exporter <br /> \u00b7 Any other relevant information. <br /> (xii) Results of the joint investigation <br /> At the conclusion of the investigations, the officials from the two authorities involved in the <br /> investigations should discuss and agree on the outcome of the investigation. <br /> The customs authorities of the importing Member State should advise the COMESA Secretariat <br /> of the outcome of the investigation. <br /> The COMESA secretariat should, in turn, notify the other COMESA member States of the results. <br /> Normally, such joint-on-the-spot investigations should help in resolving the origin query, <br /> however, where the two parties fail to agree, member States should follow dispute settlement <br /> procedures covered in paragraphs that follow. <br /> (xiii) Arbitration <br /> Any dispute between member States relating to the application of the provisions of the Protocol <br /> on Rules of Origin shall, in so far as is possible, be settled by negotiation between them and <br /> member States should desist from taking unilateral action on disputes regarding origin. <br /> However, in all cases, the settlement of disputes between the importer and the customs <br /> authorities of the importing Member State should be dealt with under the laws of that Member <br /> State. <br /> A dispute, which has not been settled by negotiation between the parties within three months, <br /> shall be referred to an Arbitration Panel comprising three members. Each party to the dispute <br /> shall appoint one member to the Panel while the parties to the dispute shall mutually agree <br /> upon the third member of the Panel. <br /> The parties to the dispute shall supply all documents and/or information to the Arbitration <br /> Panel. The documents and/or information so supplied shall also be supplied, at the same time, <br /> to the other party to the dispute and the Secretary General. <br /> The Arbitration Panel shall conduct the arbitration in such manner, as it considers appropriate <br /> provided that the parties to the dispute shall be treated with equality and that during the <br /> proceedings, each party shall be given a full opportunity of presenting its case. <br /> Upon request by any party to the dispute during the arbitration proceedings, the Panel shall <br /> hear evidence, oral or written, from any witness including experts invited by any party to the dispute. <br /> The general terms of reference of the Arbitration Panel shall be: <br /> \"To examine, in the light of the relevant provisions of the Treaty establishing the Common <br /> Market for Eastern and Southern Africa and the Protocol on the Rules of Origin, the matter <br /> presented to it and to establish findings and make such recommendation(s) as would resolve the <br /> dispute in a manner consistent with the overall development objectives of the region and to the <br /> satisfaction of the parties to the dispute.\" <br /> The Arbitration Panel shall consider the submissions from the parties to the dispute and any <br /> witness (es) and may request additional information or clarification from the parties to the <br /> dispute or the Secretary General, and make its recommendations. <br /> In making its recommendations, the Panel shall, in addition refer to any relevant authorities and <br /> provisions whether or not cited by the parties to the dispute. <br /> The Arbitration Panel shall hold its first sitting within a period of fourteen (14) days from the date <br /> of acceptance to serve on the Panel by the last panelist and shall, unless otherwise constrained, <br /> complete its task and submit its findings and recommendation(s) to the parties to the dispute <br /> and the Secretary General within a period of thirty (30) days from date of its first sitting. <br /> If the Arbitration Panel is unable, through its findings and recommendation(s) to resolve the <br /> dispute in a manner which is consistent with the overall development objectives of the region <br /> and to the satisfaction of the parties to the dispute, it shall refer the matter, through the Secretary <br /> General, to the Court of Justice for a final ruling which shall be binding on all parties. <br /> Each party to the dispute shall bear the costs attributable to the member it appointed to the <br /> Panel while the costs attributable to the third member of the Panel shall be borne in equal part <br /> by the parties to the dispute. <br /> Article 4.5 : Post-clearance control <br /> In view of the pressure of trade and to obviate delays, customs administrations will authorize <br /> their local offices to clear a considerable part of all imports after a summary check only. <br /> It is particularly in respect of such clearance that the need for post-clearance control arises. Post <br /> clearance control consists of carefully checking whether the information made available at the <br /> time of clearance was accurate as far as the originating status of goods is concerned, basing on <br /> the documents presented. <br /> In exercising such controls, over the flow of trade between Member States under the COMESA <br /> trade regime, Customs Administrations must strike a balance between promoting intra-COMESA <br /> trade, on one hand and, on the other, the need to guard against customs fraud. <br /> Checks are to be carried out as follows: <br /> After goods accepted as of COMESA origin have been cleared, the customs authorities in the <br /> importing member States can select a small percentage of the COMESA documents processed <br /> by them and subject these to thorough checks (including going all the way through the normal <br /> query and verification process) to test the adequacy of their controls and the extent to which, <br /> in seeking to facilitate the flow of intra-COMESA trade, fraudulent or irregular transactions may <br /> escape detection. <br /> In making these random post-verification checks, selection of the transactions to be investigated <br /> can be by the sensitivity of certain kinds of goods where there may be a greater inducement to <br /> evade customs controls, or by the known past record of suspect traders.", "ProvisionValueCssClass": "", "ProvisionDisplayCssClass": null}, {"ProvisionAbbrev": "pen", "ProvisionCode": "Penalties", "ProvisionValue": "provided", "ProvisionRank": null, "ProvisionGlossary": "A provision that specifies the legal consequences of submitting an origin documentation based on incorrect or falsified information.

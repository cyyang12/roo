The product-specific rule of origin that applies to a subheading is set out immediately<br /> adjacent to it.<br /> 3. The product-specific rules of origin apply to goods in which non-originating materials<br /> have been used in the production process, as provided for in Article 3.2(c).<br /> 4. Where a product-specific rule of origin is defined by a criterion of change of tariff<br /> classification accompanied by the expression \"except from\", it shall be construed to mean that<br /> the product-specific rule of origin requires that the excluded materials be originating for the<br /> good to be originating.<br /> 5. If a good is subject to a product-specific rule of origin that includes multiple requirements,<br /> the good shall be an originating good only if it satisfies all of the requirements.<br /> 1<br /> 6. If a good is subject to a product-specific rule of origin that includes alternative product-<br /> specific rules, the good shall be an originating good if it satisfies any one of the alternatives.<br /> 7. Section, Chapter or heading notes, where applicable, are found at the beginning of the<br /> relevant section or at the beginning of each Chapter, and are read in conjunction with the<br /> product-specific rules of origin and may impose further conditions on, or provide an alternative<br /> to, the product-specific rules of origin.<br /> 8. This Annex is formulated on the basis of the Harmonized System as updated as Version<br /> 2017.<br /> Section B: Chemical Chapter Origin Rules<br /> 9. Chemical Reaction Origin Rule:<br /> Notwithstanding the applicable product-specific rules of origin, a good of Chapters 28 through<br /> 40, heading 2707 or heading 2710 that is the product of a chemical reaction shall be considered<br /> to be an originating good if the chemical reaction occurred in the Area of a Party.<br /> For the purposes of the chemical reaction origin rule, a \"chemical reaction\" is a process<br /> (including a biochemical process) which results in a molecule with a new structure by breaking<br /> intramolecular bonds and by forming new intramolecular bonds, or by altering the spatial<br /> arrangement of atoms in a molecule.<br /> The following are not considered to be chemical reactions for the purposes of determining<br /> whether a good is an originating good:<br /> (a) dissolving in water or other solvents;<br /> (b) the elimination of solvents including solvent water; or<br /> (c) the addition or elimination of water of crystallisation.<br /> 10. Distillation Rule:<br /> Notwithstanding the applicable product-specific rules of origin, for the purposes of heading<br /> 2710, the following processes confer origin if the process occurred in the Area of a Party:<br /> (a) atmospheric distillation means a separation process in which petroleum oils are<br /> converted, in a distillation tower, into fractions according to boiling point and the<br /> vapour then condensed into different liquefied fractions. Goods produced from<br /> petroleum distillation may include liquefied petroleum gas, naphtha, gasoline,<br /> kerosene, diesel/heating oil, light gas oils and lubricating oil; or<br /> 2<br /> (b) vacuum distillation means distillation at a pressure below atmospheric but not so<br /> low that it would be classed as molecular distillation. Vacuum distillation is useful<br /> for distilling high-boiling and heat-sensitive materials such as heavy distillates in<br /> petroleum oils to produce light to heavy vacuum gas oils and residuum. In some<br /> refineries, gas oils may be further processed into lubricating oils.<br /> 11. Purification Origin Rule:<br /> Notwithstanding the applicable product-specific rules of origin, for the purposes of Chapters<br /> 28 through 35 or Chapter 38, purification is considered to be origin conferring if it occurred in<br /> the Area of a Party, provided that one of the following criteria is satisfied:<br /> (a) purification of a good resulting in the elimination of not less than 80% of the<br /> content of existing impurities; or<br /> (b) the reduction or elimination of impurities results in a good suitable for one or more<br /> of the following applications:<br /> (i) pharmaceutical, medicinal, cosmetic, veterinary, or food grade substances;<br /> (ii) chemical products and reagents for analytical, diagnostic or laboratory uses;<br /> (iii) elements and components for use in micro-elements;<br /> (iv) specialised optical uses;<br /> (v) non-toxic uses for health and safety;<br /> (vi) biotechnical use;<br /> (vii) carriers used in a separation process; or<br /> (viii) nuclear grade uses.<br /> 12. Mixtures and Blends Origin Rule:<br /> Notwithstanding the applicable product-specific rules of origin, a good of Chapters 30 or 31,<br /> heading 3302, subheading 3502.20, headings 3506 and 3507 or heading 3707 is an originating<br /> good if, in the Area of a Party, the deliberate and proportionally controlled mixing or blending<br /> (including dispersing) of materials to conform to predetermined specifications results in the<br /> production of a good having physical or chemical characteristics that are relevant to the<br /> purposes or uses of the good and are different from the input materials.<br /> 13. Change in Particle Size Origin Rule:<br /> Notwithstanding the applicable product-specific rules of origin, a good of Chapters 30 or 31<br /> satisfies the change in particle size origin rule if the good is the result of either of the following:<br /> 3<br /> (a) the deliberate and controlled reduction in particle size of a good, other than by<br /> merely crushing (or pressing), resulting in a good having a defined particle size,<br /> defined particle size distribution or defined surface area, which are relevant to the<br /> purposes of the resulting good and have different physical or chemical<br /> characteristics from the input materials; or<br /> (b) the deliberate and controlled modification in particle size of a good, other than by<br /> merely pressing, resulting in a good having a defined particle size, defined particle<br /> size distribution or defined surface area, which are relevant to the purposes of the<br /> resulting good and have different physical or chemical characteristics from the<br /> input materials.<br /> A good of Chapters 30 or 31 that has undergone a change in particle size shall be considered<br /> to be an originating good if the process occurred in the Area of a Party.<br /> 14. Standards Materials Origin Rule:<br /> Notwithstanding the applicable product-specific rules of origin, a standards material of<br /> Chapters 28 through 32, Chapter 35 or Chapter 38 is an originating good if the production of<br /> such good occurs in the Area of a Party. For the purposes of the standards materials origin rule,<br /> a \"standards material\" (including a standard solution) is a preparation suitable for analytical,<br /> calibrating or referencing uses with precise degrees of purity or proportions certified by the<br /> manufacturer.<br /> 15.

There are four different types of rules, which vary<br /> according to the product:<br /> (a) through working or processing a maximum content of non-originating materials is not exceeded;<br /> (b)   through working or processing the 4-digit Harmonised System heading or 6-digit Harmonised System sub\u00ad<br /> heading of the manufactured products becomes different from the 4-digit Harmonised System heading or 6-<br /> digit subheading respectively of the materials used;<br /> (c) a specific working or processing operation is carried out;<br /> (d)   working or processing is carried out on certain wholly obtained materials.<br /> Note 2 - The structure of the list<br /> 2.1. The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The column (1) gives the heading number<br /> or chapter number used in the Harmonised System and the column (2) gives the description of goods used<br /> in that system for that heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in<br /> column (3). Where, in some cases, the entry in the column (1) is preceded by an \u2018ex', this signifies that the<br /> rules in column (3) apply only to the part of that heading as described in column (2).<br /> 2.2. Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column (1) or a chapter number is given and the<br /> description of products in column (2) is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rules in column<br /> (3) apply to all products which, under the Harmonised System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in<br /> any of the headings grouped together in column (1).<br /> 2.3. Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each indent con\u00ad<br /> tains the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rules in column (3).<br /> 2.4. Where two alternative rules are set out in column (3), separated by \u2018or', it is at the choice of the exporter<br /> which one to use.<br /> Note 3 - Examples of how to apply the rules<br /> 3.1. Article 4 of Title II of Appendix I, concerning products having obtained originating status which are used in<br /> the manufacture of other products, shall apply, regardless of whether that status has been obtained inside<br /> the factory where those products are used or in another factory in a Contracting Party.<br /> 3.2. Pursuant to Article 6 of Title II of Appendix I, the working or processing carried out must go beyond the<br /> list of operations mentioned in that Article. If it does not, the goods shall not qualify for the granting of the<br /> benefit of preferential tariff treatment, even if the conditions set out in the list below are met.<br /> Subject to Article 6 of Title II of Appendix I, the rules in the list represent the minimum amount of work\u00ad<br /> ing or processing required, and the carrying-out of more working or processing also confers originating<br /> status; conversely, the carrying-out of less working or processing cannot confer originating status.<br /> Thus, if a rule provides that non-originating material, at a certain level of manufacture, may be used, the use<br /> of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed, and the use of such material at a later stage is<br /> not.<br /> If a rule provides that non-originating material, at a certain level of manufacture, may not be used, the use<br /> of materials at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed, and the use of materials at a later stage is not.<br /> Example: when the list-rule for Chapter 19 requires that \u2018non-originating materials of headings 1101 to<br /> 1108 cannot exceed 20 % weight', the use (i.e. importation) of cereals of Chapter 10 (materials at an earlier<br /> stage of manufacture) is not limited.<br /> 3.3. Without prejudice to Note 3.2, where a rule uses the expression \u2018Manufacture from materials of any head\u00ad<br /> ing', then materials of any heading(s) (even materials of the same description and heading as the product)<br /> may be used, subject, however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in the rule.<br /> However,  the  expression \u2018Manufacture  from  materials  of  any  heading,  including  other  materials  of<br /> heading \u2026' or \u2018Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of the same heading as<br /> the product' means that materials of any heading(s) may be used, except those of the same description as<br /> the product as given in column (2) of the list.<br /> 3.4. When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one material, this<br /> means that one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all be used.<br /> 3.5. Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular material, the condi\u00ad<br /> tion does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy this.<br /> 3.6. Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of non-originating materials<br /> that can be used, then those percentages may not be added together. In other words, the maximum value of<br /> all the non-originating materials used may never exceed the higher of the percentages given. Furthermore,<br /> the individual percentages shall not be exceeded, in relation to the particular materials to which they apply.<br /> Note 4 - General provisions concerning certain agricultural goods<br /> 4.1. Agricultural goods falling within Chapters 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and heading 2401 which are grown or har\u00ad<br /> vested in the territory of a Contracting Party shall be treated as originating in the territory of that Contract\u00ad<br /> ing Party, even if grown from imported seeds, bulbs, rootstock, cuttings, grafts, shoots, buds, or other live<br /> parts of plants.<br /> 4.2. In cases where the content of non-originating sugar in a given product is subject to limitations, the weight<br /> of sugars of headings 1701 (sucrose) and 1702 (e.g., fructose, glucose, lactose, maltose, isoglucose or invert<br /> sugar) used in the manufacture of the final product and used in the manufacture of the non-originating<br /> products incorporated in the final product is taken into account for the calculation of such limitations.<br /> Note 5 - Terminology used in respect of certain textile products<br /> 5.1. The term \u2018natural fibres' is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic fibres. It is<br /> restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes<br /> fibres which have been carded, combed or otherwise processed, but not spun.<br /> 5.2. The term \u2018natural fibres' includes horsehair of heading 0511, silk of headings 5002 and 5003, as well as<br /> wool-fibres and fine or coarse animal hair of headings 5101 to 5105, cotton fibres of headings 5201 to<br /> 5203, and other vegetable fibres of headings 5301 to 5305.<br /> 5.3. The terms \u2018textile pulp', \u2018chemical materials' and \u2018paper-making materials' are used in the list to describe the<br /> materials, not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or<br /> paper fibres or yarns.<br /> 5.4. The term \u2018man-made staple fibres' is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament tow, staple<br /> fibres or waste, of headings 5501 to 5507.<br /> 5.5. Printing (when combined with Weaving, Knitting/Crocheting, Tufting or Flocking) is defined as a technique<br /> by which an objectively assessed function, like colour, design, technical performance, is given to a textile<br /> substrate with a permanent character, using screen, roller, digital or transfer techniques.<br /> 5.6. Printing (as standalone operation) is defined as a technique by which an objectively assessed function, like<br /> colour, design, technical performance, is given to a textile substrate with a permanent character, using<br /> screen, roller, digital or transfer techniques combined with at least two preparatory/finishing operations<br /> (such as scouring, bleaching, mercerizing, heat setting, raising, calendaring, shrink resistance processing, per\u00ad<br /> manent finishing, decatising, impregnating, mending and burling), provided that the value of all the materi\u00ad<br /> als used does not exceed 50 % of the ex-works price of the product.<br /> Note 6 - Tolerances applicable to products made of a mixture of textile materials<br /> 6.1. Where, for a given product in the list, reference is made to this Note, the conditions set out in column<br /> (3) shall not be applied to any basic textile materials used in the manufacture of that product and which,<br /> taken together, represent 15 % or less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used (See also<br /> Notes 6.3 and 6.4).<br /> 6.2. However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 6.1 may be applied only to mixed products which have been<br /> made from two or more basic textile materials.<br /> The following are the basic textile materials:<br /> \u2014 silk;<br /> \u2014 wool;<br /> \u2014 coarse animal hair;<br /> \u2014 fine animal hair;<br /> \u2014 horsehair;<br /> \u2014 cotton;<br /> \u2014 paper-making materials and paper;<br /> \u2014 flax;<br /> \u2014 true hemp;<br /> \u2014 jute and other textile bast fibres;<br /> \u2014 sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave;<br /> \u2014 coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres;<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made filament fibres of polypropylene;<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made filament fibres of polyester;<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made filament fibres of polyamide;<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made filament fibres of polyacrylonitrile;<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made filament fibres of polyimide;<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made filament fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene;<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made filament fibres of poly(phenylene sulphide);<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made filament fibres of poly(vinyl chloride);<br /> \u2014 other synthetic man-made filament fibres;<br /> \u2014 artificial man-made filament fibres of viscose;<br /> \u2014 other artificial man-made filament fibres;<br /> \u2014 current-conducting filaments;<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene;<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester;<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide;<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile;<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide;<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene;<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(phenylene sulphide);<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(vinyl chloride);<br /> \u2014 other synthetic man-made staple fibres;<br /> \u2014 artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose;<br /> \u2014 other artificial man-made staple fibres;<br /> \u2014 yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped;<br /> \u2014 products of heading 5605 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or<br /> of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm,<br /> sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film;<br /> \u2014 other products of heading 5605;<br /> \u2014 glass fibres;<br /> \u2014 metal fibres;<br /> \u2014 mineral fibres.<br /> 6.3. In the case of products incorporating \u2018yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of<br /> polyether, whether or not gimped', this tolerance is 20 % in respect of this yarn.<br /> 6.4. In the case of products incorporating \u2018strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film<br /> whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of<br /> a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film', this tolerance is 30 % in respect of<br /> this strip.<br /> Note 7 - Other tolerances applicable to certain textile products<br /> 7.1. Where, in the list, reference is made to this Note, textile materials (with the exception of linings and interlin\u00ad<br /> ings) which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in column (3) for the made-up product concerned may<br /> be used, provided that they are classified in a heading other than that of the product and that their value<br /> does not exceed 15 % of the ex-works price of the product.<br /> 7.2. Without prejudice to Note 6.3, materials which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63 may be used<br /> freely in the manufacture of textile products, whether or not they contain textiles.<br /> 7.3. Where a percentage rule applies, the value of non-originating materials which are not classified within<br /> Chapters 50 to 63 must be taken into account when calculating the value of the non-originating materials<br /> incorporated.<br /> Note 8 - Definition of specific processes and simple operations carried out in respect of certain products of<br /> Chapter 27<br /> 8.1. For the purposes of headings ex 2707 and 2713, the \u2018specific processes' are the following:<br /> (a) vacuum-distillation;<br /> (b)   redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;<br /> (c) cracking;<br /> (d)   reforming;<br /> (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f) the process comprising all of the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid,<br /> oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification<br /> with naturally active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;<br /> (g) polymerisation;<br /> (h)   alkylation;<br /> (i) isomerisation.<br /> 8.2.

If the declaration is handwritten, it shall be written in ink in printed <br /> characters. <br /> 5. Origin declarations shall bear the original signature of the exporter in manuscript. However, an approved <br /> exporter within the meaning of Article 19 shall not be required to sign such declarations provided that he gives the <br /> customs authorities of the exporting Contracting Party a written undertaking that he accepts full responsibility for <br /> any origin declaration which identifies him as if it had been signed in manuscript by him. <br /> 6. An origin declaration may be made out by the exporter when the products to which it relates are exported, or <br /> after exportation (the \u2018retrospective origin declaration') on condition that it is presented in the importing country <br /> within two years after the importation of the products to which it relates. <br /> Where the splitting of a consignment takes place in accordance with Article 14(3) and provided that the same two- <br /> year deadline is respected, the retrospective origin declaration shall be made out by the approved exporter of the <br /> Contracting Party of exportation of the products. <br /> Article 20 : Procedure for issuing of a movement certificate EUR.1 <br /> 1. A movement certificate EUR.1 shall be issued by the customs authorities of the exporting Contracting Party <br /> on application having been made in writing by the exporter or, under the exporter's responsibility, by his authorised <br /> representative. <br /> 2. For that purpose, the exporter or his authorised representative shall fill in both the movement certificate <br /> EUR.1 and the application form, specimens of which appear in Annex IV to this Appendix. Those forms shall be <br /> completed in one of the languages in which this Convention is drawn up and in accordance with the provisions of <br /> the national law of the exporting country. If the completion of the forms is done in handwriting, they shall be <br /> completed in ink in printed characters.

Where the box is not completely filled, a horizontal line shall be drawn <br /> below the last line of the description, the empty space being crossed through. <br /> 3. The exporter applying for the issue of a movement certificate EUR.1 shall be prepared to submit at any time, <br /> at the request of the customs authorities of the exporting Contracting Party where the movement certificate EUR.1 <br /> is issued, all appropriate documents proving the originating status of the products concerned as well as the fulfil- <br /> ment of the other requirements of this Convention. <br /> 4. A certificate of origin shall be issued by the competent authorities of the exporting Contracting Party if the <br /> products concerned can be considered as products originating and fulfil the other requirements of this Convention. <br /> 5. The customs authorities issuing movement certificates EUR.1 shall take any steps necessary to verify the origi- <br /> nating status of the products and the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Convention. For that purpose, <br /> they shall have the right to call for any evidence and to carry out any inspection of the exporter's accounts or any <br /> other check considered appropriate. They shall also ensure that the forms referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article <br /> are duly completed. In particular, they shall check whether the space reserved for the description of the products <br /> has been completed in such a manner as to exclude all possibility of fraudulent additions. <br /> 6. The date of issue of the movement certificate EUR.1 shall be indicated in Box 11 of the movement <br /> certificate EUR.1. <br /> 7. A movement certificate EUR.1 shall be issued by the customs authorities and made available to the exporter <br /> as soon as actual exportation has been effected or ensured. <br /> Article 22 : Issue of a duplicate movement certificate EUR.1 <br /> 1. In the event of theft, loss or destruction of a movement certificate EUR.1, the exporter may apply to the <br /> customs authorities which issued it for a duplicate made out on the basis of the export documents in their <br /> possession. <br /> 2. The duplicate issued in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article shall be endorsed with the following word <br /> in English: \u2018DUPLICATE'. <br /> 3. The endorsement referred to in paragraph 2 shall be inserted in Box 7 of the duplicate movement <br /> certificate EUR.1. <br /> 4.

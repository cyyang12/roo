The Competent Authorities of the importing Signatory Party shall make efforts to conclude the <br /> investigation within one hundred and twenty (120) days from the date of the receipt of the <br /> information requested in accordance with Article 29 of this Chapter. <br /> 2.

Once the investigation establishes the non-qualification of the origin criterion of the goods <br /> contained in the Certificate of Origin, duties shall be charged as if the goods were imported from <br /> third countries and the sanctions established in this Agreement and/or the ones foreseen in the <br /> legislation in force in each Signatory Party shall be applied. <br /> 2. In such a case, the Competent Authorities of the importing Signatory Party may deny <br /> preferential tariff treatment to new imports relating to identical goods from the same producer, <br /> until it is clearly demonstrated that the manufacturing conditions were modified so as to fulfill the <br /> provisions of this Chapter. <br /> 3. Once the Competent Authorities of the exporting Signatory Party have sent the information <br /> demonstrating that the manufacturing conditions were modified, the Competent Authorities of the <br /> importing Signatory Party shall have forty five (45) days, from the date of the receipt of the said <br /> information to communicate its decision on the matter, or a maximum of ninety (90) days if a new <br /> verification visit to the producer's premises, according to paragraph e) of Article 29 of this <br /> Chapter, is deemed necessary. <br /> 4. If the Competent Authorities of the importing and the exporting Signatory Party fail to agree on <br /> the demonstration of the modification on the manufacturing conditions, they may make use of the <br /> procedure established as in Article 40 of this Chapter. <br /> Article 38 <br /> 1. A Signatory Party may request another Signatory Party to investigate the origin of a good <br /> imported by the latter from another Signatory Party, whenever there are well-founded reasons for <br /> suspecting that the goods of the first Signatory Party undergo competition from imported goods <br /> with preferential tariff treatment, which do not fulfill the provisions of this Chapter. <br /> 2. For such purposes, the Competent Authorities of the Signatory Party requesting the <br /> investigation shall bring to the Competent Authorities of the importing Signatory Party the <br /> relevant information within forty-five (45) days, from the date of the request. Once this <br /> information is received, the importing Signatory Party may initiate the proceedings established in <br /> this Chapter, giving notice of this to the Signatory Party that requested the initiation of the investigation. <br /> Article 39 <br /> Procedures for control and verification of origin under this Chapter may be applied even to goods <br /> released for consumption. <br /> Article 40 <br /> Within sixty (60) days from the receipt of the communication, under Article 34 or in the third <br /> paragraph of Article 37 of this Chapter, if the measure is considered inconsistent, the exporting <br /> Signatory Party, may submit a query to the Joint Committee of the Agreement stating the <br /> technical and legal reasons which indicate that the measure taken by the Competent Authorities of <br /> the importing Signatory Party does not conform to this Chapter, and/or seek a formal statement to <br /> determine whether the good in question complies with the provisions of this Chapter. <br /> Article 41 <br /> The deadlines laid down in this Chapter shall be calculated based on consecutive days beginning <br /> on the day following the facts or events to which they relate.", "ProvisionValueCssClass": "", "ProvisionDisplayCssClass": null}, {"ProvisionAbbrev": "pen", "ProvisionCode": "Penalties", "ProvisionValue": "not provided", "ProvisionRank": null, "ProvisionGlossary": "A provision that specifies the legal consequences of submitting an origin documentation based on incorrect or falsified information.

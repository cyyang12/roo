The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column gives<br /> the subheading number, heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonised<br /> System and the second column gives the description of goods used in that system for<br /> that subheading, heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns, a rule is<br /> specified in column 3 or 4. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is<br /> preceded by an \u2018ex', this signifies that the rules in column 3 or 4 apply only to the<br /> part of that subheading or heading as described in column 2.<br /> 2.2.  Where several subheading or heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a<br /> chapter number is given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in<br /> general terms, the adjacent rules in column 3 or 4 apply to all products which, under the<br /> Harmonised System, are classified in subheadings or headings of the chapter or in any<br /> of the subheadings or headings grouped together in column 1.<br /> 2.3.  Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a<br /> subheading  or  heading, each  indent  contains  the  description  of  that  part  of  the<br /> subheading or heading covered by the adjacent rules in column 3 or 4.<br /> 2.4.  Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns 3 and 4,<br /> the exporter may opt, as an alternative, to apply either the rule set out in column 3 or<br /> that set out in column 4. If no origin rule is given in column 4, the rule set out in<br /> column 3 is to be applied.<br /> N o t e 3:<br /> 3.1.  The provisions of Article 5 of this Protocol, concerning products having acquired<br /> originating status which are used in the manufacture of other products, shall apply,<br /> regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where these<br /> products are used or in another factory in a Party.<br /> Example:<br /> An engine of heading 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-<br /> originating materials which may be incorporated may not exceed 50 percent of the ex-<br /> works price, is made from materials of heading 7201, 7202, 7203, 7204, 7205, or<br /> subheading 722410.<br /> If this material has been processed in the UK from a non-originating ingot, it has already<br /> acquired originating status by virtue of the rule for subheading 722490 in the list. The<br /> material can then count as originating in the value-calculation for the engine, regardless<br /> 412<br /> of whether it was produced in the same factory or in another factory in the UK. The<br /> value of the non-originating ingot is thus not taken into account when adding up the<br /> value of the non-originating materials used.<br /> 3.2. The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing required,<br /> and the carrying-out of more working or processing also confers originating status;<br /> conversely, the carrying-out of less working or processing cannot confer originating<br /> status. Thus, if a rule provides that non-originating material, at a certain level of<br /> manufacture, may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is<br /> allowed, and the use of such material at a later stage is not.<br /> 3.3. Without prejudice to Note 3.2, where a rule uses the expression \u2018Manufacture from<br /> materials of any heading', then materials of any heading(s) (even materials of the same<br /> description and heading as the product) may be used, subject, however, to any specific<br /> limitations which may also be contained in the rule.<br /> However, the expression \u2018Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other<br /> materials of heading \u2026' means that materials of any heading(s) may be used, except<br /> those of the same description as the product as given in column 2 of the list.<br /> 3.4. When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one<br /> material, this means that one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all<br /> be used.<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for fabrics of headings 5208 to 5212 provides that natural fibres may be used<br /> and that chemical materials, among other materials, may also be used. This does not<br /> mean that both have to be used; it is possible to use one or the other, or both.<br /> 3.5. Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular<br /> material, the condition obviously does not prevent the use of other materials which,<br /> because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule. (See also Note 6.2 below in<br /> relation to textiles.)<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for prepared foods of heading 1904, which specifically excludes the use of<br /> cereals and their derivatives, does not prevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and<br /> other additives which are not products produced from cereals.<br /> However, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be manufactured<br /> from the particular materials specified in the list, can be produced from a material of the<br /> same nature at an earlier stage of manufacture.<br /> Example:<br /> In the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 made from non-woven materials, if<br /> the use of only non- originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is not possible<br /> to start from non-woven cloth - even if non- woven cloths cannot normally be made<br /> from yarn. In such cases, the starting material would normally be at the stage before<br /> yarn - that is, the fibre stage.<br /> 413<br /> 3.6.  Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of non-<br /> originating materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be added<br /> together. In other words, the maximum value of all the non- originating materials used<br /> may never exceed the higher of the percentages given. Furthermore, the individual<br /> percentages must not be exceeded, in relation to the particular materials to which they<br /> apply.<br /> N o t e 4:<br /> 4.1.  The term \u2018natural fibres' is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or<br /> synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste,<br /> and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres which have been carded, combed or<br /> otherwise processed, but not spun.<br /> 4.2.  The term \u2018natural fibres' includes horsehair of heading 0503, silk of heading 5002 and<br /> 5003, as well as wool-fibres and fine or coarse animal hair of headings 5101 to 5105,<br /> cotton fibres of headings 5201 to 5203, and other vegetable fibres of headings 5301 to<br /> 5305<br /> 4.3.  The terms \u2018textile pulp', \u2018chemical materials' and \u2018paper-making materials' are used in<br /> the list to describe the materials, not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used<br /> to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.<br /> 4.4.  The term \u2018man-made staple fibres' is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial<br /> filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of headings 5501 to 5507.<br /> N o t e 5:<br /> 5.1.  Where, for a given product in the list, reference is made to this Note, the conditions set<br /> out in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials used in the<br /> manufacture of this product and which, taken together, represent 10 percent or less of<br /> the total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 5.3 and 5.4<br /> below.)<br /> 5.2.  However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 5.1 may be applied only to mixed products<br /> which have been made from two or more basic textile materials.<br /> The following are the basic textile materials:<br /> \u2014 silk,<br /> \u2014 wool,<br /> \u2014 coarse animal hair,<br /> \u2014 fine animal hair,<br /> \u2014 horsehair,<br /> \u2014 cotton,<br /> \u2014 paper-making materials and paper,<br /> \u2014 flax,<br /> \u2014 true hemp,<br /> \u2014 jute and other textile bast fibres,<br /> 414<br /> \u2014 sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave,<br /> \u2014 coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,<br /> \u2014 synthetic  man-made filaments,<br /> \u2014 artificial  man-made filaments,<br /> \u2014 current-conducting  filaments,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres,<br /> \u2014 artificial man-made staple fibres,<br /> \u2014 yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped,<br /> \u2014 yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester, whether or not gimped,<br /> \u2014 products of heading 5605 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core of<br /> aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium<br /> powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or<br /> coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film,<br /> \u2014 other products of heading 5605.<br /> Example:<br /> A yarn, of heading 5205, made from cotton fibres of heading 5203 and synthetic staple<br /> fibres of heading 5506, is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple<br /> fibres which do not satisfy the origin-rules (which require manufacture from chemical<br /> materials or textile pulp) may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed<br /> 10 percent of the weight of the yarn.<br /> Example:<br /> A woollen fabric, of heading 5112, made from woollen yarn of heading 5107 and<br /> synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading 5509, is a mixed fabric. Therefore, synthetic<br /> yarn which does not satisfy the origin-rules (which require manufacture from chemical<br /> materials or textile pulp), or woollen yarn which does not satisfy the origin-rules (which<br /> require manufacture from natural fibres, not carded or combed or otherwise prepared for<br /> spinning), or a combination of the two, may be used, provided that their total weight<br /> does not exceed 10 percent of the weight of the fabric.<br /> Example:<br /> Tufted textile fabric, of heading 5802, made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and<br /> cotton fabric of heading 5210, is only a mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a<br /> mixed fabric made from yarns classified in two separate headings, or if  the cotton yarns<br /> used are themselves mixtures.<br /> Example:<br /> If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading 5205<br /> and synthetic fabric of heading 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate<br /> basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is, accordingly, a mixed product.<br /> 5.3. In the case of products incorporating \u2018yarn made of polyurethane segmented with<br /> flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped', this tolerance is 20 percent in<br /> respect of this yarn.<br /> 5.4. In the case of products incorporating \u2018strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a<br /> core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not<br /> exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between<br /> two layers of plastic film',  this tolerance is 30  percent in  respect of  this strip.<br /> 415<br /> N o t e 6:<br /> 6.1.  Where, in the list, reference is made to this Note, textile materials (with the exception of<br /> linings and interlinings), which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3 for<br /> the made-up product concerned, may be used, provided that they are classified in a<br /> heading other than that of the product and that their value does not exceed eight percent<br /> of  the ex-works price of the  product.<br /> 6.2.  Without prejudice to Note 6.3, materials, which are not classified within Chapters 50 to<br /> 63, may be used freely in the manufacture of textile products, whether or not they<br /> contain textiles.<br /> Example:<br /> If a rule in the list provides that, for a particular textile item (such as trousers), yarn must<br /> be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because buttons<br /> are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63. For the same reason, it does not prevent the<br /> use of slide-fasteners, even though slide-fasteners normally contain textiles.<br /> 6.3.  Where a percentage-rule applies, the value of materials which are not classified within<br /> Chapters 50 to 63 must be taken into account when calculating the value of the non-<br /> originating materials incorporated.<br /> 416", "ShowProductAffected": false, "ProductAffected": null, "RevisionName": null, "Rank": 0, "ShowRooExceptions": false, "RooExceptions": null}], "SpecificNote": [{"RooCode": null, "RooText": null, "ShowProductAffected": false, "ProductAffected": null, "RevisionName": null, "Rank": 0, "ShowRooExceptions": false, "RooExceptions": null}], "Documents": [{"DocDesc": "Certificate of origin", "DocFileName": "itc00992_coo.pdf", "DocType": "1_coo", "WebLink": null}, {"DocDesc": "Product-specific rules of origin", "DocFileName": "itc00992_sroo.pdf", "DocType": "2_sroo", "WebLink": null}, {"DocDesc": "Chapter on rules of origin", "DocFileName": "itc00992_roo.pdf", "DocType": "3_roo", "WebLink": "https://www.fta.go.kr/webmodule/_PSD_FTA/uk/2/eng/54%20Protocol%20(Originating%20Products)_eng.pdf"}, {"DocDesc": "Chapter on origin procedures", "DocFileName": "itc00992_proo.pdf", "DocType": "4_proo", "WebLink": null}, {"DocDesc": "Customs administration", "DocFileName": "itc00992_cusa.pdf", "DocType": "5_cusa", "WebLink": "https://www.fta.go.kr/webmodule/_PSD_FTA/uk/2/eng/24%20Chapter%206_eng.pdf"}, {"DocDesc": "Full text of agreement", "DocFileName": "itc00992_full.pdf", "DocType": "8_full", "WebLink": "https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ukkorea-free-trade-agreement-with-exchange-of-notes-cs-korea-no12019"}]}, "FtaProvisions": {"RooProvision": [{"ProvisionAbbrev": "accum", "ProvisionCode": "Cumulation", "ProvisionValue": "full+cross-cumulation", "ProvisionRank": null, "ProvisionGlossary": "A provision which allows to consider goods obtained in as well as processing taking place in one FTA member country as originating in another.", "ProvisionGlossaryLink": "/en/glossary?uid=accum&returnto=gloscenter", "ProvisionLegalExtract": "Article 3 : Cumulation of origin <br /> 1.

Should the Panel rule that the conditions of <br /> paragraph 2 are fulfilled, unless otherwise agreed, the Parties shall, normally within 90 days and in no case more than <br /> 150 days of the ruling, limit the maximum rate of customs duties on non-originating material for that product that can <br /> be refunded to five percent. <br /> The base year for the purpose of evaluating the statistical data under this Article will be the average of the latest three years immediately <br /> before the entry into force of this Agreement, each year being the fiscal year of January through December.

There are four different types of rule, which vary according to<br /> the product:<br /> (a) through working or processing, a maximum content of non-originating<br /> materials is not exceeded;<br /> (b) through working or processing, the applicable 4-digit Harmonized System<br /> heading or 6-digit Harmonized System sub-heading for the manufactured<br /> products becomes different from the respective 4-digit Harmonized<br /> System heading or 6-digit sub-heading for the materials used;<br /> (c) a specific working and processing operation is carried out; and<br /> (d) working or processing is carried out on certain wholly-obtained materials.<br /> Note 2 - The structure of the list<br /> 2.1 The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column<br /> gives the heading number or Chapter number used in the Harmonized System and<br /> the second column gives the description of goods used in that system for that<br /> heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in<br /> column 3. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an<br /> \"ex\", this signifies that the rules in column 3 apply only to the part of that heading<br /> as described in column 2.<br /> 2.2 Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1, or a<br /> Chapter number is given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore<br /> given in general terms, the adjacent rules in column 3 apply to all products which,<br /> under the Harmonized System, are classified in headings of the Chapter or in any<br /> of the headings grouped together in column 1.<br /> 2.3 Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a<br /> heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered<br /> by the adjacent rules in column 3.<br /> 2.4 Where two alternative rules are set out in column 3, separated by \"or\", it is at the<br /> choice of the exporter which one to use.<br /> Note 3 - Examples of how to apply the rules<br /> 3.1 Article 5 (Sufficiently Worked or Processed Products) of the Protocol, concerning<br /> products having acquired originating status which are used in the manufacture of<br /> other products, shall apply, regardless of whether this status has been acquired<br /> inside the factory where these products are used or in another factory in a Party.<br /> 3.2 Pursuant to Article 6 (Insufficient Working or Processing) of the Protocol, the<br /> working or processing carried out must go beyond the list of operations mentioned<br /> in that Article. If it does not, the goods shall not qualify for the granting of the<br /> benefit of preferential tariff treatment, even if the conditions set out in the list<br /> below are met.<br /> Subject to the provision referred to in the first sub-paragraph, the rules in the list<br /> represent the minimum amount of working or processing required, and the<br /> carrying-out of more working or processing also confers originating status;<br /> conversely, the carrying-out of less working or processing cannot confer<br /> originating status.<br /> Thus, if a rule provides that non-originating material may be used at a certain stage<br /> of manufacture, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is<br /> allowed, and the use of such material at a later stage is not.<br /> If a rule provides that non-originating material, at a certain level of manufacture,<br /> may not be used, the use of materials at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed,<br /> and the use of materials at a later stage is not.<br /> Example: when the list-rule for Chapter 19 requires that \"non-originating<br /> materials of headings 1101 to 1108 cannot exceed 20 per cent weight\", the use<br /> (i.e. importation) of cereals of Chapter 10 (materials at an earlier stage of<br /> manufacture) is not limited.<br /> 3.3 Without prejudice to Note 3.2, where a rule uses the expression \"Manufacture<br /> from materials of any heading\", then materials of any heading(s) (even materials<br /> of the same description and heading as the product) may be used, subject,<br /> however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in the rule.<br /> The expression \"Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other<br /> materials of heading [...]\" or \"Manufacture from materials of any heading,<br /> including other materials of the same heading as the product\" means that materials<br /> of any heading(s) may be used, except those of the same description as the product<br /> as given in column 2 of the list.<br /> 3.4 When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more<br /> than one material, this means that one or more materials may be used. It does not<br /> require that all be used.<br /> 3.5 Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a<br /> particular material, the rule does not prevent the use of other materials which,<br /> because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy this condition.<br /> 3.6 Where a rule in the list gives two percentages for the maximum value of non-<br /> originating materials that can be used, those percentages may not be added<br /> together. In other words, the maximum value of all the non-originating materials<br /> used may never exceed the higher of the percentages given. Furthermore, the<br /> individual percentages must not be exceeded in relation to the particular materials<br /> to which they apply.<br /> Note 4 - General provisions concerning certain agricultural goods<br /> 4.1 Agricultural goods which fall within Chapters 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and heading 2401,<br /> and which are grown or harvested in the territory of a beneficiary country, shall<br /> be treated as originating in the territory of that country, even if grown from seeds,<br /> bulbs, rootstock, cuttings, grafts, shoots, buds, or other live parts of plants<br /> imported from another country.<br /> 4.2 In cases where the content of non-originating sugar in a given product is subject<br /> to limitations, the weight of sugars of headings 1701 (sucrose) and 1702 (e.g.,<br /> fructose, glucose, lactose, maltose, isoglucose or invert sugar) used in the<br /> manufacture of the final product and used in the manufacture of the non-<br /> originating products incorporated in the final product is taken into account for the<br /> calculation of such limitations.<br /> Note 5 - Terminology used in respect of certain textile products<br /> 5.1 The term \"natural fibres\" is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or<br /> synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including<br /> waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres which have been carded,<br /> combed or otherwise processed, but not spun.<br /> 5.2 The term \"natural fibres\" includes horsehair of heading 0511, silk of headings<br /> 5002 and 5003, as well as wool-fibres and fine or coarse animal hair of headings<br /> 5101 to 5105, cotton fibres of headings 5201 to 5203, and other vegetable fibres<br /> of headings 5301 to 5305.<br /> 5.3 The terms \"textile pulp\", \"chemical materials\" and \"paper-making materials\" are<br /> used in the list to describe the materials which are not classified in Chapters 50 to<br /> 63, but which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or<br /> yarns.<br /> 5.4 The term \"man-made staple fibres\" is used in the list to refer to synthetic or<br /> artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of headings 5501 to 5507.<br /> Note 6 - Tolerances applicable to products made of a mixture of textile materials<br /> 6.1 Where, for a given product in the list, reference is made to this Note, the conditions<br /> set out in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials used in the<br /> manufacture of this product and which, taken together, represent 10 % or less of<br /> the total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 6.3 and 6.4).<br /> 6.2 The tolerance mentioned in Note 6.1 may be applied only to mixed products<br /> which have been made from two or more basic textile materials.<br /> The following are the basic textile materials:<br /> - silk;<br /> - wool;<br /> - coarse animal hair;<br /> - fine animal hair;<br /> - horsehair;<br /> - cotton;<br /> - paper-making materials and paper;<br /> - flax;<br /> - true hemp;<br /> - jute and other textile bast fibres;<br /> - sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave;<br /> - coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres;<br /> - synthetic man-made filaments;<br /> - artificial man-made filaments;<br /> - current-conducting filaments;<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene;<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester;<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide;<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile;<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide;<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene;<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(phenylene sulphide);<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(vinyl chloride);<br /> - other synthetic man-made staple fibres;<br /> - artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose;<br /> - other artificial man-made staple fibres;<br /> - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of<br /> polyether, whether or not gimped;<br /> - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of<br /> polyester, whether or not gimped;<br /> - products of heading 5605 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip<br /> consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film<br /> whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not<br /> exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or<br /> coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film;<br /> - other products of heading 5605;<br /> - glass fibres;<br /> - metal fibres.<br /> Example:<br /> A yarn, of heading 5205, made from cotton fibres of heading 5203 and<br /> synthetic staple fibres of heading 5506, is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-<br /> originating synthetic staple fibres which do not satisfy the origin rules may<br /> be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10 % of the<br /> weight of the yarn.<br /> Example:<br /> A woollen fabric of heading 5112 that is made from woollen yarn of<br /> heading 5107 and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading 5509 is a<br /> mixed fabric. Therefore, synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the origin<br /> rules, or woollen yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules, or a<br /> combination of the two, may be used, provided that their total weight does<br /> not exceed 10 % of the weight of the fabric.<br /> Example:<br /> Tufted textile fabric of heading 5802 that is made from cotton yarn of<br /> heading 5205 and cotton fabric of heading 5210 is only a mixed product if<br /> the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric made from yarns classified in two<br /> separate headings, or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.<br /> Example:<br /> If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of<br /> heading 5205 and synthetic fabric of heading 5407, then, obviously, the<br /> yarns used are two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile<br /> fabric is, accordingly, a mixed product.<br /> 6.3 In the case of products incorporating \"yarn made of polyurethane segmented with<br /> flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped\", this tolerance is 20 % in<br /> respect of this yarn.<br /> 6.4 In the case of products incorporating a \"strip consisting of a core of aluminium<br /> foil or of a core of plastic film, whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of<br /> a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured<br /> adhesive between two layers of plastic film\", the tolerance is 30 % in respect of<br /> this strip.<br /> Note 7 - Other tolerances applicable to certain textile products<br /> 7.1 Where, in the list, reference is made to this Note, textile materials (with the<br /> exception of linings and interlinings) which do not satisfy the rule set out in the<br /> list in column 3 for the made-up product concerned may be used, provided that<br /> they are classified under a heading other than that of the product, and provided<br /> that that their value does not exceed 8 % of the ex-works price of the product.<br /> 7.2 Without prejudice to Note 6.3, materials, which are not classified within<br /> Chapters 50 to 63, may be used freely in the manufacture of textile products,<br /> whether or not they contain textiles.<br /> Example:<br /> If a rule in the list provides that, for a particular textile item (such as trousers),<br /> yarn must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items such as buttons,<br /> because buttons are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63. For the same reason,<br /> it does not prevent the use of slide- fasteners, even though slide-fasteners normally<br /> contain textiles.<br /> 7.3 Where a percentage rule applies, the value of non-originating materials which are<br /> not classified within Chapters 50 to 63 must be taken into account when<br /> calculating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.<br /> Note 8 - Definition of specific processes and simple operations carried out in<br /> respect of certain products of Chapter 27<br /> 8.1 For the purposes of headings ex 2707 and 2713, the \"specific processes\" are the<br /> following:<br /> (a) vacuum-distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;<br /> (c) cracking;<br /> (d) reforming;<br /> (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f) the process comprising all of the following operations: processing with<br /> concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation<br /> with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification with naturally active<br /> earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;<br /> (g) polymerisation;<br /> (h) alkylation;<br /> (i) isomerisation.<br /> 8.2 For the purposes of headings 2710, 2711 and 2712, the \"specific processes\" are<br /> the following:<br /> (a) vacuum-distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;<br /> (c) cracking;<br /> (d) reforming;<br /> (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f) the process comprising all of the following operations: processing with<br /> concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation<br /> with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification with naturally active<br /> earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;<br /> (g) polymerisation;<br /> (h) alkylation;<br /> (i) isomerisation;<br /> (j) in respect of heavy oils of heading ex 2710 only, desulphurisation with<br /> hydrogen, resulting in a reduction of at least 85 % of the sulphur content<br /> of the products processed (ASTM D 1266-59 T method);<br /> (k) in respect of products of heading 2710 only, deparaffining by a process<br /> other than filtering;<br /> (l) in respect of heavy oils of heading ex 2710 only, treatment with hydrogen,<br /> at a pressure of more than 20 bar and a temperature of more than 250 \u00b0C,<br /> with the use of a catalyst, other than to effect desulphurisation, when the<br /> hydrogen constitutes an active element in a chemical reaction. The further<br /> treatment, with hydrogen, of lubricating oils of heading ex 2710 (e.g.<br /> hydrofinishing or decolourisation), in order, more especially, to improve<br /> colour or stability shall not, however, be deemed to be a specific process;<br /> (m) in respect of fuel oils of heading ex 2710 only, atmospheric distillation, on<br /> condition that less than 30 % of these products distils, by volume,<br /> including losses, at 300 \u00b0C, by the ASTM D 86 method;<br /> (n) in respect of heavy oils other than gas oils and fuel oils of heading ex 2710<br /> only, treatment by means of a high-frequency electrical brush discharge;<br /> (o) in respect of crude products (other than petroleum jelly, ozokerite, lignite<br /> wax or peat wax, paraffin wax containing by weight less than 0,75 % of<br /> oil) of heading ex 2712 only, de-oiling by fractional crystallisation.<br /> 8.3 For the purposes of headings ex 2707 and 2713, simple operations, such as<br /> cleaning, decanting, desalting, water separation, filtering, colouring, marking,<br /> obtaining a sulphur content as a result of mixing products with different sulphur<br /> contents, or any combination of these operations or like operations, do not confer", "ShowProductAffected": false, "ProductAffected": null, "RevisionName": null, "Rank": 0, "ShowRooExceptions": false, "RooExceptions": null}], "SpecificNote": [{"RooCode": null, "RooText": null, "ShowProductAffected": false, "ProductAffected": null, "RevisionName": null, "Rank": 0, "ShowRooExceptions": false, "RooExceptions": null}], "Documents": [{"DocDesc": "Certificate of origin", "DocFileName": "itc01101_coo.pdf", "DocType": "1_coo", "WebLink": null}, {"DocDesc": "Product-specific rules of origin", "DocFileName": "itc01101_sroo.pdf", "DocType": "2_sroo", "WebLink": null}, {"DocDesc": "Chapter on rules of origin", "DocFileName": "itc01101_roo.pdf", "DocType": "3_roo", "WebLink": null}, {"DocDesc": "Chapter on origin procedures", "DocFileName": "itc01101_proo.pdf", "DocType": "4_proo", "WebLink": null}, {"DocDesc": "Full text of agreement", "DocFileName": "itc01101_full.pdf", "DocType": "8_full", "WebLink": "https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uksingapore-free-trade-agreement-cs-singapore-no12020"}]}, "FtaProvisions": {"RooProvision": [{"ProvisionAbbrev": "accum", "ProvisionCode": "Cumulation", "ProvisionValue": "full+cross-cumulation with EU / cross-cumulation (with restriction) with other ASEAN countries", "ProvisionRank": null, "ProvisionGlossary": "A provision which allows to consider goods obtained in as well as processing taking place in one FTA member country as originating in another.", "ProvisionGlossaryLink": "/en/glossary?uid=accum&returnto=gloscenter", "ProvisionLegalExtract": "ARTICLE 3 : Cumulation of Origin <br /> 1.

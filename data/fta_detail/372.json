The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column gives the heading number or<br /> chapter number used in the Harmonised System and the second column gives the description of goods used in<br /> that system for that heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in column 3<br /> or 4. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an \u2018ex', this signifies that the rules in<br /> column 3 or 4 apply only to the part of that heading as described in column 2.<br /> 2.2.  Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number is given and the<br /> description of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rules in column 3 or 4<br /> apply to all products which, under the Harmonised System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in any of<br /> the headings grouped together in column 1.<br /> 2.3.  Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each indent contains<br /> the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rules in column 3 or 4.<br /> 2.4.  Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns 3 and 4, the exporter may opt,<br /> as an alternative, to apply either the rule set out in column 3 or that set out in column 4. If no origin rule is<br /> given in column 4, the rule set out in column 3 is to be applied.<br /> Note 3:<br /> 3.1.  The provisions of Article 5 of this Annex, concerning products having acquired originating status which are used<br /> in the manufacture of other products, shall apply, regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the<br /> factory where these products are used or in another factory in the Community or in Chile.<br /> Example:<br /> An engine of heading 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-originating materials which may<br /> be incorporated may not exceed 40 % of the ex-works price, is made from \u2018other alloy steel roughly shaped by<br /> forging' of heading ex 7224.<br /> If  this  forging  has  been  forged  in  the  Community  from  a  non-originating  ingot,  it  has  already  acquired<br /> originating status by virtue of the rule for heading ex 7224 in the list. The forging can then count as originating<br /> in the value-calculation for the engine, regardless of whether it was produced in the same factory or in another<br /> factory in the Community. The value of the non-originating ingot is thus not taken into account when adding up<br /> the value of the non-originating materials used.<br /> 3.2.  The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing required, and the carrying-out of<br /> more working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the carrying-out of less working or<br /> processing cannot confer originating status. Thus, if a rule provides that non-originating material, at a certain<br /> level of manufacture, may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed, and the<br /> use of such material at a later stage is not.<br /> 3.3.  Without prejudice to Note 3.2, where a rule uses the expression \u2018Manufacture from materials of any heading',<br /> then materials of any heading(s) (even materials of the same description and heading as the product) may be<br /> used, subject, however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in the rule.<br /> 30.12.2002<br /> However, the expression \u2018Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of heading ...' or<br /> \u2018Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of the same heading as the product' means<br /> that materials of any heading(s) may be used, except those of the same description as the product as given in<br /> column 2 of the list.<br /> 3.4. When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one material, this means<br /> that one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all be used.<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for fabrics of headings 5208 to 5212 provides that natural fibres may be used and that chemical<br /> materials, among other materials, may also be used. This does not mean that both have to be used; it is possible<br /> to use one or the other, or both.<br /> 3.5. Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular material, the condition<br /> obviously does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the<br /> rule. (See also Note 6.2 below in relation to textiles).<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for prepared foods of heading 1904, which specifically excludes the use of cereals and their derivatives,<br /> does not prevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and other additives which are not products from cereals.<br /> However, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be manufactured from the particular<br /> materials specified in the list, can be produced from a material of the same nature at an earlier stage of<br /> manufacture.<br /> Example:<br /> In the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter<br /> non-originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is not possible to start from non-woven cloth \u2014 even if<br /> non-woven cloths cannot normally be made from yarn. In such cases, the starting material would normally be at<br /> the stage before yarn \u2014 that is, the fibre stage.<br /> 3.6. Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of non-originating materials that<br /> can be used, then these percentages may not be added together. In other words, the maximum value of all the<br /> non-originating materials used may never exceed the higher of the percentages given. Furthermore, the individual<br /> percentages must not be exceeded, in relation to the particular materials to which they apply.<br /> Note 4:<br /> 4.1.  The term \u2018natural fibres' is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic fibres. It is restricted<br /> to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres which<br /> have been carded, combed or otherwise processed, but not spun.<br /> 4.2.  The term \u2018natural fibres' includes horsehair of heading<br /> wool-fibres and fine or coarse animal hair of headings 5101 to 5105, cotton fibres of headings 5201 to 5203,<br /> and other vegetable fibres of headings 5301 to 5305.<br /> 4.3.  The terms \u2018textile pulp', \u2018chemical materials' and \u2018paper-making materials' are used in the list to describe the<br /> materials, not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper<br /> fibres or yarns.<br /> 4.4.  The term \u2018man-made staple fibres' is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament tow, staple fibres or<br /> waste, of headings 5501 to 5507.<br /> 952<br /> Note 5:<br /> 5.1. Where, for a given product in the list, reference is made to this Note, the conditions set out in column 3 shall<br /> not be applied to any basic textile materials used in the manufacture of this product and which, taken together,<br /> represent 10 % or less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 5.3 and 5.4)<br /> 5.2. However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 5.1 may be applied only to mixed products which have been made<br /> from two or more basic textile materials.<br /> The following are the basic textile materials:<br /> \u2014 silk,<br /> \u2014 wool,<br /> \u2014 coarse animal hair,<br /> \u2014 fine animal hair,<br /> \u2014 horsehair,<br /> \u2014 cotton,<br /> \u2014 paper-making materials and paper,<br /> \u2014 flax,<br /> \u2014 true hemp,<br /> \u2014 jute and other textile bast fibres,<br /> \u2014 sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave,<br /> \u2014 coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made filaments,<br /> \u2014 artificial man-made filaments,<br /> \u2014 current-conducting filaments,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(phenylene sulphide),<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(vinyl chloride),<br /> \u2014 other synthetic man-made staple fibres,<br /> \u2014 artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose,<br /> \u2014 other artificial man-made staple fibres,<br /> \u2014 yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped,<br /> \u2014 yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester, whether or not gimped,<br /> 30.12.2002<br /> \u2014 products of heading 5605 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a<br /> core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm,<br /> sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film,<br /> \u2014 other products of heading 5605.<br /> Example:<br /> A yarn, of heading 5205, made from cotton fibres of heading 5203 and synthetic staple fibres of heading 5506,<br /> is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres which do not satisfy the origin-rules (which<br /> require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) may be used, provided that their total weight does<br /> not exceed 10 % of the weight of the yarn.<br /> Example:<br /> A woollen fabric, of heading 5112, made from woollen yarn of heading 5107 and synthetic yarn of staple fibres<br /> of heading 5509, is a mixed fabric. Therefore, synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the origin-rules (which<br /> require  manufacture  from  chemical  materials  or textile  pulp),  or woollen  yarn  which  does  not  satisfy the<br /> origin-rules (which require manufacture from natural fibres, not carded or combed or otherwise prepared for<br /> spinning), or a combination of the two, may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10 % of<br /> the weight of the fabric.<br /> Example:<br /> Tufted textile fabric, of heading 5802, made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and cotton fabric of heading<br /> 5210, is a only mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric made from yarns classified in two<br /> separate headings, or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.<br /> Example:<br /> If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and synthetic fabric of<br /> heading 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric<br /> is, accordingly, a mixed product.<br /> 5.3. In the case of products incorporating \u2018yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether,<br /> whether or not gimped', this tolerance is 20 % in respect of this yarn.<br /> 5.4. In the case of products incorporating \u2018strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film<br /> whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a<br /> transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film', this tolerance is 30 % in respect of this strip.<br /> Note 6:<br /> 6.1.  Where, in the list, reference is made to this Note, textile materials (with the exception of linings and interlinings),<br /> which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the made-up product concerned, may be used,<br /> provided that they are classified in a heading other than that of the product and that their value does not exceed<br /> 8 % of the ex-works price of the product.<br /> 6.2.  Without prejudice to Note 6.3, materials, which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63, may be used freely<br /> in the manufacture of textile products, whether or not they contain textiles.<br /> Example:<br /> If a rule in the list provides that, for a particular textile item (such as trousers), yarn must be used, this does not<br /> prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because buttons are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63. For<br /> the same reason, it does not prevent the use of slide-fasteners, even though slide-fasteners normally contain<br /> textiles.<br /> 6.3.  Where a percentage-rule applies, the value of materials which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63 must<br /> be taken into account when calculating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.<br /> 954<br /> Note 7:<br /> 7.1. For the purposes of headings ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex 3403, the \u2018specific processes' are<br /> the following:<br /> (a) vacuum-distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation-process (1),<br /> (c) cracking;<br /> (d) reforming;<br /> (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f) the process comprising all of the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum<br /> or  sulphuric  anhydride;  neutralisation  with  alkaline  agents;  decolourisation  and  purification  with<br /> naturally-active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;<br /> (g) polymerisation;<br /> (h) alkylation;<br /> (i) isomerisation.<br /> 7.2. For the purposes of headings 2710, 2711 and 2712, the \u2018specific processes' are the following:<br /> (a) vacuum-distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation-process (1),<br /> (c) cracking;<br /> (d) reforming;<br /> (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f) the process comprising all of the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum<br /> or  sulphuric  anhydride;  neutralisation  with  alkaline  agents;  decolourisation  and  purification  with<br /> naturally-active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;<br /> (g) polymerisation;<br /> (h) alkylation;<br /> (ij) isomerisation;<br /> (k) in respect of heavy oils of heading ex 2710 only, desulphurisation with hydrogen, resulting in a reduction<br /> of at least 85 % of the sulphur-content of the products processed (ASTM D 1266\u201459 T method);<br /> (l) in respect of products of heading 2710 only, deparaffining by a process other than filtering;<br /> (m) in respect of heavy oils of heading ex 2710 only, treatment with hydrogen, at a pressure of more than 20<br /> bar and a temperature of more than 250 \u00b0C, with the use of a catalyst, other than to effect desulphurisation,<br /> when  the  hydrogen  constitutes  an  active  element  in  a  chemical  reaction.  The  further  treatment,  with<br /> hydrogen, of lubricating oils of heading ex 2710 (e.g. hydrofinishing or decolourisation), in order, more<br /> especially, to improve colour or stability shall not, however, be deemed to be a specific process;<br /> (n) in respect of fuel oils of heading ex 2710 only, atmospheric distillation, on condition that less than 30 % of<br /> these products distils, by volume, including losses, at 300 \u00b0C, by the ASTM D 86 method;<br /> (o) in respect of heavy oils other than gas oils and fuel oils of heading ex 2710 only, treatment by means of a<br /> high-frequency electrical brush-discharge;<br /> (p) in respect of crude products (other than petroleum jelly, ozokerite, lignite wax or peat wax, paraffin wax<br /> containing by weight less than 0,75 % of oil) of heading ex 2712 only, de-oiling by fractional crystallisation.<br /> (1) See introductory Note 7.4.<br /> 30.12.2002<br /> 7.3.  For the purposes of headings ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex 3403, simple operations, such as<br /> cleaning, decanting, desalting, water-separation, filtering, colouring, marking, obtaining a sulphur-content as a<br /> result  of  mixing  products  with  different  sulphur-contents,  or  any  combination  of  these  operations  or  like<br /> operations, do not confer origin.<br /> 7.4.  Redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process means distillation (other than topping) by a continuous or<br /> batch process employed in industrial installations using distillates of subheading Nos<br /> 2711 11, 2711 12 to 2711 19, 2711 21 and 2711 29 (other than propane of a purity of 99 % or more) to<br /> obtain:<br /> 1.  isolated high-purity hydrocarbons (90 % or more in the case of olefins and 95 % or more in the case of<br /> other hydrocarbons), mixtures of isomers having the same organic composition being regarded as isolated<br /> hydrocarbons;<br /> only those process by means of which at least three different products are obtained are admissible, but this<br /> restriction does not apply in any instance where the process consists in the separation of isomers. In so far<br /> this concerns xylenes, ethylbenzene is included with xylene isomers;<br /> 2.

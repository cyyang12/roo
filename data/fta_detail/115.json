The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column gives the heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonised System and the second column gives the description of goods used in that system for that heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in column 3 or\u00a04. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an \u2018ex', this signifies that the rules in column 3 or\u00a04 apply only to the part of that heading as described in column 2.<br /> 2.2. Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number is given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rules in column 3 or 4 apply to all products which, under the Harmonised System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in any of the headings grouped together in column 1.<br /> 2.3. Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rules in column 3 or 4.<br /> 2.4. Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns 3 and 4, the exporter may opt to apply either the rule set out in column 3 or that set out in column 4. If no origin rule is given in column 4, the rule set out in column 3 is to be applied.<br /> Note 3<br /> 3.1. The provisions of Article 5 of this Appendix, concerning products having acquired originating status which are used in the manufacture of other products, shall apply, regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where those products are used or in another factory in one of the Parties.<br /> 3.2. The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing required, and the carrying-out of more working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the carrying-out of less working or processing cannot confer originating status. Thus, if a rule provides that non-originating material, at a certain level of manufacture, may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed, and the use of such material at a later stage is not.<br /> 3.3. Without prejudice to Note 3.2, where a rule uses the expression \u2018Manufacture from materials of any heading', then materials of any heading(s) (even materials of the same description and heading as the product) may be used, subject, however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in the rule.<br /> However, the expression \u2018Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of heading \u2026' or \u2018Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of the same heading as the product' means that materials of any heading(s) may be used, except those of the same description as the product as given in column 2 of the list.<br /> 3.4. When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one material, this means that one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all be used.<br /> 3.5. Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular material, the condition does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule.<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for prepared foods of heading 19.04, which specifically excludes the use of cereals and their derivatives, does not prevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and other additives which are not products from cereals.<br /> However, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be manufactured from the particular materials specified in the list, can be produced from a material of the same nature at an earlier stage of manufacture.<br /> 3.6. Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of non-originating materials that can be used, then those percentages may not be added together. In other words, the maximum value of all the non-originating materials used may never exceed the higher of the percentages given. Furthermore, the individual percentages must not be exceeded, in relation to the particular materials to which they apply.", "ShowProductAffected": false, "ProductAffected": null, "RevisionName": null, "Rank": 0, "ShowRooExceptions": false, "RooExceptions": null}], "SpecificNote": [{"RooCode": null, "RooText": null, "ShowProductAffected": false, "ProductAffected": null, "RevisionName": null, "Rank": 0, "ShowRooExceptions": false, "RooExceptions": null}], "Documents": [{"DocDesc": "Certificate of origin", "DocFileName": "itc00118_coo.pdf", "DocType": "1_coo", "WebLink": null}, {"DocDesc": "Product-specific rules of origin", "DocFileName": "itc00118_sroo.pdf", "DocType": "2_sroo", "WebLink": null}, {"DocDesc": "Chapter on rules of origin", "DocFileName": "itc00118_roo.pdf", "DocType": "3_roo", "WebLink": "https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:1999:191:0001:0033:EN:PDF"}, {"DocDesc": "Full text of agreement", "DocFileName": "itc00118_full.pdf", "DocType": "8_full", "WebLink": "https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:L:1990:374:FULL&from=EN"}]}, "FtaProvisions": {"RooProvision": [{"ProvisionAbbrev": "accum", "ProvisionCode": "Cumulation", "ProvisionValue": "cross-cumulation", "ProvisionRank": null, "ProvisionGlossary": "A provision which allows to consider goods obtained in as well as processing taking place in one FTA member country as originating in another.", "ProvisionGlossaryLink": "/en/glossary?uid=accum&returnto=gloscenter", "ProvisionLegalExtract": "TITLE VII <br /> CEUTA AND MELILLA <br /> Article 33 : Application of the Appendix <br /> Application of the Appendix <br /> 1.

In the cases referred <br /> to in the second paragraph of Article 22, the invoice declaration may be made out by approved exporters of <br /> Turkey within the meaning of Article 34. <br /> (2) The exporter making out an invoice declaration shall be prepared to submit at any time, at the request <br /> of the customs or other competent governmental authorities of the exporting country, all appropriate documents <br /> proving the originating status of the products concerned and relative documents proving the fulfilment of <br /> provisions of this Decision. <br /> (3) An invoice declaration shall be made out by the exporter in either Turkish, French or English by typing, <br /> stamping or printing on the invoice, the delivery note or any other commercial document, the declaration, the <br /> text of which appears in Annex 5. If the declaration is handwritten, it shall be written in ink in printed characters. <br /> Invoice declarations shall bear the original signature of the exporter in manuscript. <br /> (4) The use of an invoice declaration shall be subject to the following conditions: <br /> a) one invoice declaration shall be made out for each consignment; <br /> b) if the goods contained in the consignment have already been subject to verification in the exporting <br /> country by reference to the definition of @^@originating products@^@, the exporter may refer to that verification <br /> in the invoice declaration. <br /> Article 25: Submission of proofs of Origin <br /> (1) Proofs of origin shall be submitted to the customs authorities of the Turkey in accordance <br /> with customs legislation and other concerned legislation. <br /> (2) Where proofs of origin required for the preferential treatment of goods can not be presented before <br /> or at the time of actual importation of the goods concerned and the goods are intended to be imported without <br /> delay by the importer, the preferential regime shall not be applied and the duties shall be calculated and definitely <br /> collected on the basis of autonomous duty rates. However, if the proofs of origin duly completed are submitted <br /> to the customs authority which fulfilled the procedures within the period of validity following the actual importation <br /> of this kind of goods, the difference between the duty amount calculated on the base of preferential rate and that <br /> calculated on the base of non-preferential shall be repaid to the operator, on condition that it is understood that <br /> the proofs of origin submitted relates to the goods imported by comparing with the customs declaration and its <br /> enclosures and that the period of validity of the proof of origin is not expired. <br /> (3) Proofs of origin which are submitted to the customs authorities of the importing country after the period <br /> of validity mentioned in Article 4(6) may be accepted for the purpose of applying the tariff preferences, where <br /> failure to submit these documents by the final date set is due to exceptional circumstances. In other cases of <br /> belated presentation, the customs authorities of the importing country may accept the proofs of origin where the <br /> products have been presented to customs before the said final date. <br /> (4) In cases of belated presentation, in order to benefit from the preferential treatment, the goods have <br /> to be submitted before the final date of submission of the proof of origin and an application in writing has to be <br /> presented to the customs authorities in the said period by the importer or his authorized representative entitled to <br /> sign the customs declaration. The customs authority concerned shall inform the supervising regional headquarter <br /> on the issue. The latter shall examine the case and may extend the period of validity of the proof of origin <br /> maxiumum one mounth's time if it considers the existence of force majeure and extraordinary circumstances and <br /> agrees that the resons justify such demand. <br /> Article 27: Submission of a single proof of Origin <br /> (1) At the request of the importer and having regard to the conditions laid down by the Ministry, <br /> a single proof of origin may be submitted to the customs authorities at the importation of the first <br /> consignment when the goods: <br /> a) are imported within the framework of frequent and continuous trade flows of a significant commercial value; <br /> b) are the subject of the same contract of sale, the parties of this contract established in the exporting <br /> country or Turkey; <br /> c) are classified in the same code (eight digits) of the Combined Nomenclature; <br /> d) come exclusively from the same exporter, are destined for the same importer, and are made the subject <br /> of entry formalities at the same customs office of Turkey. <br /> (2) This procedure shall be applicable for a period determined by the competent customs authorities. <br /> Article 28: Duplicate certificates of origin Form A <br /> (1) When originating products are placed under the control of a customs office of Turkey, it <br /> shall be possible to replace the original proof of origin by one or more certificates of origin Form A for the purpose <br /> of sending all or some of these products to European Union, Norway, or Switzerland. <br /> (2) Replacement certificates of origin Form A shall be issued by the customs office under whose control <br /> the products are placed. The replacement certificate shall be made out on the basis of a written request by the re- exporter. <br /> (3) The top right-hand box of the replacement certificate shall indicate the name of the intermediary <br /> country where it is issued. Box 4 shall contain the words: <br /> MUFREZ BELGEDIR <br /> REPLACEMENT CERTIFICATE <br /> CERTIFICAT DE REMPLACEMENT <br /> as well as the date of issue of the original certificate of origin and its serial number. The name of the <br /> re-exporter shall be given in box 1. The name of the final consignee may be given in box 2. All particulars of the <br /> re-exported products appearing on the original certificate shall be transferred to boxes 3 to 9 and references to <br /> the re-exporter's invoice shall be given in box 10. <br /> (4) The customs authorities which issued the replacement certificate shall endorse box 11. The <br /> responsibility of the authorities shall be confined to the issue of the replacement certificate. The particulars in box <br /> 12 concerning the country of origin and the country of destination shall be taken from the original certificate. This <br /> box shall be signed by the re-exporter. A re-exporter who signs this box in good faith shall not be responsible for <br /> the accuracy of the particulars entered on the original certificate. <br /> (5) The customs office which is requested to perform the operation referred to in paragraph 1 shall note on <br /> the original certificate the weights, numbers and nature of the products forwarded and indicate thereon the serial <br /> numbers of the corresponding replacement certificate or certificates. It shall keep the original certificate for at least <br /> three years. A photocopy of the original certificate may be annexed to the replacement certificate. <br /> (6) In the case of products which benefit from the tariff preferences under a derogation granted in <br /> accordance with Article 19, the procedure laid down in this Article shall apply only when such products are <br /> intended for the customs offices in customs territory of Turkey. Where the product concerned has acquired <br /> originating status through regional cumulation, a replacement certificate may only be made out for sending <br /> products to the European Union, Norway or Switzerland where these countries apply the same regional <br /> cumulation rules as Turkey.", "ProvisionValueCssClass": "", "ProvisionDisplayCssClass": null}, {"ProvisionAbbrev": "exmptcoo", "ProvisionCode": "Exemption of certification", "ProvisionValue": "included (less than EUR500)", "ProvisionRank": null, "ProvisionGlossary": "A provision which lists exemptions from the requirement to provide a proof of origin.

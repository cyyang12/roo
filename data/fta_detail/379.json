This Annex sets out the general rules for the applicable requirements of Annex 3-B provided<br /> for in subparagraph 1(c) of Article 3.2.<br /> 2. For the purposes of this Annex and Annex 3-B, the requirements for a product to be<br /> originating in accordance with subparagraph 1(c) of Article 3.2 are a change in tariff<br /> classification, a production process, a maximum value of non-originating materials, a<br /> minimum regional value content, or any other requirement specified in this Annex and<br /> Annex 3-B.<br /> 3. Reference to weight in a product specific rule of origin means the net weight, which is the<br /> weight of a material or a product, not including the weight of packaging.<br /> 4. This Annex, Annex 3-B and Annex 3-E are based on the Harmonized System, as amended on<br /> 1 January 2017.<br /> Note 2<br /> The structure of Annex 3-B<br /> 1. Notes on Sections or Chapters, where applicable, are read in conjunction with the product<br /> specific rules of origin for the relevant Section, Chapter, heading or subheading.<br /> 2. Each product specific rule of origin set out in Column 2 of Annex 3-B applies to the<br /> corresponding product identified in Column 1 of Annex 3-B.<br /> 3. If a product is subject to alternative product specific rules of origin, the product shall be<br /> originating if it satisfies one of the alternatives. If a product is subject to a product specific<br /> rule of origin that includes multiple requirements, the product shall be originating only if it<br /> satisfies all of the requirements.<br /> 4. For the purpose of this Annex and Annex 3-B,<br /> (a) \"Chapter\" means the first two-digits in the tariff classification number under the<br /> Harmonized System;<br /> (b) \"heading\" means the first four-digits in the tariff classification number under the<br /> Harmonized System;<br /> (c) \"Section\" means a section of the Harmonized System; and<br /> (d) \"subheading\" means the first six-digits in the tariff classification number under the<br /> Harmonized System.<br /> 5. For the purposes of product specific rules of origin, the following abbreviations apply:1<br /> \"CC\" means production from non-originating materials of any Chapter, except that of<br /> the product, or a change to the Chapter, heading or subheading from any other<br /> Chapter; this means that all non-originating materials used in the production of<br /> the product must undergo a change in tariff classification at the 2-digit level<br /> (i.e. a change in Chapter) of the Harmonized System.<br /> \"CTH\" means production from non-originating materials of any heading, except that of<br /> the product, or a change to the Chapter, heading or subheading from any other<br /> heading; this means that all non-originating materials used in the production of<br /> the product must undergo a change in tariff classification at the 4-digit level<br /> (i.e. a change in heading) of the Harmonized System.<br /> \"CTSH\" means production from non-originating materials of any subheading, except that<br /> of the product, or a change to the Chapter, heading or subheading from any other<br /> subheading; this means that all non-originating materials used in the production<br /> of the product must undergo a change in tariff classification at the 6-digit level<br /> (i.e. a change in sub-heading) of the Harmonized System.<br /> For greater certainty, if a requirement of a change in tariff classification provides for<br /> exception for a change from certain Chapters, headings or subheadings, none of the<br /> non-originating materials of those Chapters, headings or subheadings may be used,<br /> individually or jointly.<br /> Note 3<br /> Application of Annex 3-B<br /> 1. Paragraph 3 of Article 3.2, concerning products having acquired originating status which are<br /> used in the production of other products, applies irrespective of whether or not this status has<br /> been acquired inside the same factory in a Party where those products are used.<br /> 2. If a product specific rule of origin provides that a specified non-originating material may not<br /> be used or that the value or weight of a specified non-originating material cannot exceed a<br /> specific threshold, those requirements do not apply to non-originating materials classified<br /> elsewhere in the Harmonized System.<br /> 3. If a product specific rule of origin provides that a product shall be produced from a particular<br /> material, this does not prevent the use of other materials which cannot satisfy the requirement<br /> because of their inherent nature.<br /> Note 4<br /> Calculation of a maximum value of non-originating materials<br /> and of a minimum regional value content<br /> Definitions:<br /> 1. For the purposes of product specific rules of origin:<br /> (a) \"customs value\" means the value as determined in accordance with the Agreement on<br /> Implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994;<br /> (b) \"EXW\" means:<br /> (i) the ex-works price of the product paid or payable to the manufacturer in whose<br /> undertaking the last working or processing is carried out, provided that the price<br /> includes the value of all the materials used and all other costs incurred in the<br /> production of a product minus any internal taxes which are, or may be, repaid<br /> when the product obtained is exported; or<br /> (ii) if there is no price paid or payable or if the actual price paid does not reflect all<br /> costs related to the production of the product which are actually incurred in the<br /> production of the product, the value of all the materials used and all other costs<br /> incurred in the production of a product in the exporting Party which:<br /> (A) include selling, general and administrative expenses, as well as profit, that<br /> can be reasonably allocated to the product; and<br /> (B) exclude the costs of freight, insurance, all other costs incurred in<br /> transporting the product and any internal taxes of the exporting Party which<br /> are, or may be, repaid when the product obtained is exported;<br /> (c) \"FOB\" means:<br /> (i) the free on board price of the product paid or payable to the seller regardless of<br /> the mode of shipment, provided that the price includes the value of all the<br /> materials used and all other costs incurred in the production of a product and its<br /> transportation to the exportation port in the Party, minus any internal taxes which<br /> are, or may be, repaid when the product obtained is exported; or<br /> (ii) if there is no price paid or payable or if the actual price paid does not reflect all<br /> costs related to the production of the product which are actually incurred in the<br /> production of a product, the value of all the materials used and all other costs<br /> incurred in the production of a product in the exporting Party, and its<br /> transportation to the exportation port in the Party which:<br /> (A) include selling, general and administrative expenses, as well as profit, that<br /> can be reasonably allocated to the product, the costs of freight and<br /> insurance; and<br /> (B) exclude any internal taxes of the exporting Party which are, or may be,<br /> repaid when the product obtained is exported;<br /> (d) \"MaxNOM\" means the maximum value of non-originating materials expressed as a<br /> percentage;<br /> (e) \"RVC\" means the minimum regional value content of a product, expressed as a<br /> percentage; and<br /> (f) \"VNM\" means the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the<br /> product which is its customs value at the time of importation including freight,<br /> insurance where appropriate, packing and all the other costs incurred in transporting the<br /> materials to the importation port in the Party where the producer of the product is<br /> located. Where it is not known and cannot be ascertained, the first ascertainable price<br /> paid for the non-originating materials in the either Party is used.<br /> 2. For the calculation of MaxNOM and RVC, the following formulas apply:<br /> VNM<br /> MaxNOM(%) = \u2014\u2014 x 100<br /> EXW<br /> FOB - VNM<br /> RVC(%) = -\u2014- x 100<br /> Note 5<br /> Definitions of processes referred to in Sections V to VII in Annex 3-B<br /> For the purposes of product specific rules of origin:<br /> (a) \"biotechnological processing\" means:<br /> (i) biological or biotechnological culturing (including cell culture), hybridisation or genetic<br /> modification of micro-organisms (bacteria, viruses (including phages) etc.) or human,<br /> animal or plant cells; and<br /> (ii) production, isolation or purification of cellular or intercellular structures (such as<br /> isolated genes, gene fragments and plasmids), or fermentation;<br /> (b) \"change in particle size\" means the deliberate and controlled modification in particle size of a<br /> product, other than by merely crushing or pressing, resulting in a product with a defined<br /> particle size, defined particle size distribution or defined surface area, which is relevant to the<br /> purposes of the resulting product and with physical or chemical characteristics different from<br /> those of the input materials;<br /> (c) \"chemical reaction\" means a process (including a biochemical processing) which results in a<br /> molecule with a new structure by breaking intramolecular bonds and by forming new<br /> intramolecular bonds, or by altering the spatial arrangement of atoms in a molecule, with the<br /> exception of the following which are not considered to be chemical reactions for the purpose<br /> of this definition:<br /> (i) dissolving in water or other solvents;<br /> (ii) the elimination of solvents including solvent water; or<br /> (iii) the addition or elimination of water of crystallisation;<br /> (d) \"distillation\" means:<br /> (i) atmospheric distillation: a separation process in which petroleum oils are converted, in a<br /> distillation tower, into fractions according to boiling point and the vapour then<br /> condensed into different liquefied fractions; products produced from petroleum<br /> distillation may include liquefied petroleum gas, naphtha, gasoline, kerosene, diesel or<br /> heating oil, light gas oils and lubricating oil; and<br /> (ii) vacuum distillation: distillation at a pressure below atmospheric but not so low that it<br /> would be classed as molecular distillation; vacuum distillation is used for distilling<br /> high-boiling and heat-sensitive materials such as heavy distillates in petroleum oils to<br /> produce light to heavy vacuum gas oils and residuum;<br /> (e) \"isomer separation\" means the isolation or separation of isomers from a mixture of isomers;<br /> (f) \"mixing and blending\" means the deliberate and proportionally controlled mixing or blending<br /> (including dispersing) of materials, other than the addition of diluents, only to conform to<br /> predetermined specifications which results in the production of a product having physical or<br /> chemical characteristics that are relevant to the purposes or uses of the product and are<br /> different from the input materials;<br /> (g) \"production of standard materials\" (including standard solutions) means a production of a<br /> preparation suitable for analytical, calibrating or referencing uses with precise degrees of<br /> purity or proportions certified by the manufacturer; and<br /> (h) \"purification\" means a process which results in the elimination of at least 80 per cent of the<br /> content of existing impurities.<br /> Note 6<br /> Definitions of terms used in Section XI of Annex 3-B<br /> For the purposes of product specific rules of origin:<br /> (a) \"man-made staple fibres\" means synthetic or artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of<br /> headings 55.01 to 55.07;<br /> (b) \"natural fibres\" means fibres other than synthetic or artificial fibres.

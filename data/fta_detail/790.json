There are four different types of rules, which vary according to the<br /> product:<br /> (a) through working or processing a maximum content of non-originating<br /> materials is not exceeded;<br /> (b) through working or processing the 4-digit Harmonized System heading or 6-<br /> digit Harmonized System sub-heading of the manufactured products becomes<br /> different from the 4-digit Harmonized System heading or 6-digit sub-heading<br /> respectively of the materials used;<br /> (c) a specific working and processing operation is carried out; and<br /> (d) working or processing is carried out on certain wholly obtained materials.<br /> Note 2 - The structure of the list<br /> 2.1. The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column gives<br /> the heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonized System and the<br /> second column gives the description of goods used in that system for that heading or<br /> chapter. For each entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in column 3.<br /> Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an \"ex\", this<br /> signifies that the rules in column 3 apply only to the part of that heading as described<br /> in column 2.<br /> 2.2. Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter<br /> number is given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in<br /> general terms, the adjacent rules in column 3 apply to all products which, under the<br /> Harmonized System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in any of the<br /> headings grouped together in column 1.<br /> 2.3. Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a<br /> heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by<br /> the adjacent rules in column 3.<br /> 2.4. Where two alternative rules are set out in column 3, separated by \"or\", it is at the<br /> choice of the exporter which one to use.<br /> Note 3 - Examples of how to apply the rules<br /> 3.1. Article 5 (Sufficiently Worked or Processed Products) of the Protocol, concerning<br /> products having acquired originating status which are used in the manufacture of<br /> other products, shall apply, regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside<br /> the factory where these products are used or in another factory in a Party.<br /> 3.2. Pursuant to Article 6 (Insufficient Working or Processing) of the Protocol, the<br /> working or processing carried out must go beyond the list of operations mentioned in<br /> that Article. If it does not, the goods shall not qualify for the granting of the benefit of<br /> preferential tariff treatment, even if the conditions set out in the list below are met.<br /> Subject to the provision referred to in the first sub-paragraph, the rules in the list<br /> represent the minimum amount of working or processing required, and the carrying-<br /> out of more working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the<br /> carrying-out of less working or processing cannot confer originating status.<br /> Thus, if a rule provides that non-originating material, at a certain level of<br /> manufacture, may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture<br /> is allowed, and the use of such material at a later stage is not.<br /> If a rule provides that non-originating material, at a certain level of manufacture, may<br /> not be used, the use of materials at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed, and the<br /> use of materials at a later stage is not.<br /> Example: when the list-rule for Chapter 19 requires that \"non-originating materials of<br /> headings 1101 to 1108 cannot exceed 20% weight\", the use (i.e. importation) of<br /> cereals of Chapter 10 (materials at an earlier stage of manufacture) is not limited.<br /> 3.3. Without prejudice to Note 3.2, where a rule uses the expression \"Manufacture from<br /> materials of any heading\", then materials of any heading(s) (even materials of the<br /> same description and heading as the product) may be used, subject, however, to any<br /> specific limitations which may also be contained in the rule.<br /> However, the expression \"Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other<br /> materials of heading ...\" or \"Manufacture from materials of any heading, including<br /> other materials of the same heading as the product\" means that materials of any<br /> heading(s) may be used, except those of the same description as the product as given<br /> in column 2 of the list.<br /> 3.4. When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than<br /> one material, this means that one or more materials may be used. It does not require<br /> that all be used.<br /> 3.5. Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a<br /> particular material, the rule does not prevent the use of other materials which, because<br /> of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy this condition.<br /> 3.6. Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of non-<br /> originating materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be added<br /> together. In other words, the maximum value of all the non-originating materials used<br /> may never exceed the higher of the percentages given. Furthermore, the individual<br /> percentages must not be exceeded, in relation to the particular materials to which they<br /> apply.<br /> Note 4 - General provisions concerning certain agricultural goods<br /> 4.1. Agricultural goods falling within Chapters 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and heading 2401 which<br /> are grown or harvested in the territory of a beneficiary country shall be treated as<br /> originating in the territory of that country, even if grown from seeds, bulbs, rootstock,<br /> cuttings, grafts, shoots, buds, or other live parts of plants imported from another<br /> country.<br /> 4.2. In cases where the content of non-originating sugar in a given product is subject to<br /> limitations, the weight of sugars of headings 1701 (sucrose) and 1702 (e.g., fructose,<br /> glucose, lactose, maltose, isoglucose or invert sugar) used in the manufacture of the<br /> final product and used in the manufacture of the non-originating products<br /> incorporated in the final product is taken into account for the calculation of such<br /> limitations.<br /> Note 5 - Terminology used in respect of certain textile products<br /> 5.1. The term \"natural fibres\" is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or<br /> synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including<br /> waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres which have been carded,<br /> combed or otherwise processed, but not spun.<br /> 5.2. The term \"natural fibres\" includes horsehair of heading 0511, silk of headings 5002<br /> and 5003, as well as wool-fibres and fine or coarse animal hair of headings 5101<br /> to 5105, cotton fibres of headings 5201 to 5203, and other vegetable fibres of<br /> headings 5301 to 5305.<br /> 5.3. The terms \"textile pulp\", \"chemical materials\" and \"paper-making materials\" are used<br /> in the list to describe the materials, not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be<br /> used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.<br /> 5.4. The term \"man-made staple fibres\" is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial<br /> filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of headings 5501 to 5507.<br /> Note 6 - Tolerances applicable to products made of a mixture of textile materials<br /> 6.1. Where, for a given product in the list, reference is made to this Note, the conditions<br /> set out in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials used in the<br /> manufacture of this product and which, taken together, represent 10 % or less of the<br /> total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 6.3 and 6.4).<br /> 6.2. However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 6.1 may be applied only to mixed products<br /> which have been made from two or more basic textile materials.<br /> The following are the basic textile materials:<br /> - silk;<br /> - wool;<br /> - coarse animal hair;<br /> - fine animal hair;<br /> - horsehair;<br /> - cotton;<br /> - paper-making materials and paper;<br /> - flax;<br /> - true hemp;<br /> - jute and other textile bast fibres;<br /> - sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave;<br /> - coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres;<br /> - synthetic man-made filaments;<br /> - artificial man-made filaments;<br /> - current-conducting filaments;<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene;<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester;<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide;<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile;<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide;<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene;<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(phenylene sulphide);<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(vinyl chloride);<br /> - other synthetic man-made staple fibres;<br /> - artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose;<br /> - other artificial man-made staple fibres;<br /> - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether,<br /> whether or not gimped;<br /> - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester,<br /> whether or not gimped;<br /> - products of heading 5605 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a<br /> core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with<br /> aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a<br /> transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film;<br /> - other products of heading 5605;<br /> - glass fibres;<br /> - metal fibres.<br /> Example:<br /> A yarn, of heading 5205, made from cotton fibres of heading 5203 and synthetic staple fibres<br /> of heading 5506, is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres which do<br /> not satisfy the origin rules may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10%<br /> of the weight of the yarn.<br /> Example:<br /> A woollen fabric, of heading 5112, made from woollen yarn of heading 5107 and synthetic<br /> yarn of staple fibres of heading 5509, is a mixed fabric. Therefore, synthetic yarn which does<br /> not satisfy the origin rules, or woollen yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules, or a<br /> combination of the two, may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10% of<br /> the weight of the fabric.<br /> Example:<br /> Tufted textile fabric, of heading 5802, made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and cotton<br /> fabric of heading 5210, is only a mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric<br /> made from yarns classified in two separate headings, or if the cotton yarns used are<br /> themselves mixtures.<br /> Example:<br /> If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and<br /> synthetic fabric of heading 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic<br /> textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is, accordingly, a mixed product.<br /> 6.3. In the case of products incorporating \"yarn made of polyurethane segmented with<br /> flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped\", this tolerance is 20 % in<br /> respect of this yarn.<br /> 6.4. In the case of products incorporating \"strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or<br /> of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not<br /> exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between<br /> two layers of plastic film\", this tolerance is 30 % in respect of this strip.<br /> Note 7 - Other tolerances applicable to certain textile products<br /> 7.1. Where, in the list, reference is made to this Note, textile materials (with the exception<br /> of linings and interlinings), which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3<br /> for the made-up product concerned, may be used, provided that they are classified in a<br /> heading other than that of the product and that their value does not exceed 8 % of the<br /> ex-works price of the product.<br /> 7.2. Without prejudice to Note 6.3, materials, which are not classified within Chapters 50<br /> to 63, may be used freely in the manufacture of textile products, whether or not they<br /> contain textiles.<br /> Example:<br /> If a rule in the list provides that, for a particular textile item (such as trousers), yarn must be<br /> used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because buttons are not<br /> classified within Chapters 50 to 63. For the same reason, it does not prevent the use of slide-<br /> fasteners, even though slide-fasteners normally contain textiles.<br /> 7.3. Where a percentage rule applies, the value of non-originating materials which are not<br /> classified within Chapters 50 to 63 must be taken into account when calculating the<br /> value of the non-originating materials incorporated.<br /> Note 8 - Definition of specific processes and simple operations carried out in respect of<br /> certain products of Chapter 27<br /> 8.1. For the purposes of headings ex 2707 and 2713, the \"specific processes\" are the<br /> following:<br /> (a) vacuum-distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;<br /> (c) cracking;<br /> (d) reforming;<br /> (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f) the process comprising all of the following operations: processing with<br /> concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with<br /> alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification with naturally active earth,<br /> activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;<br /> (g) polymerisation;<br /> (h) alkylation;<br /> (i) isomerisation.<br /> 8.2. For the purposes of headings 2710, 2711 and 2712, the \"specific processes\" are the<br /> following:<br /> (a) vacuum-distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;<br /> (c) cracking;<br /> (d) reforming;<br /> (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f) the process comprising all of the following operations: processing with<br /> concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with<br /> alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification with naturally active earth,<br /> activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;<br /> (g) polymerisation;<br /> (h) alkylation;<br /> (i) isomerisation;<br /> (j) in respect of heavy oils of heading ex 2710 only, desulphurisation with<br /> hydrogen, resulting in a reduction of at least 85 % of the sulphur content of the<br /> products processed (ASTM D 1266-59 T method);<br /> (k) in respect of products of heading 2710 only, deparaffining by a process other<br /> than filtering;<br /> (l) in respect of heavy oils of heading ex 2710 only, treatment with hydrogen, at a<br /> pressure of more than 20 bar and a temperature of more than 250 \u00b0C, with the<br /> use of a catalyst, other than to effect desulphurisation, when the hydrogen<br /> constitutes an active element in a chemical reaction. The further treatment,<br /> with hydrogen, of lubricating oils of heading ex 2710 (e.g. hydrofinishing or<br /> decolourisation), in order, more especially, to improve colour or stability shall<br /> not, however, be deemed to be a specific process;<br /> (m) in respect of fuel oils of heading ex 2710 only, atmospheric distillation, on<br /> condition that less than 30 % of these products distils, by volume, including<br /> losses, at 300 \u00b0C, by the ASTM D 86 method;<br /> (n) in respect of heavy oils other than gas oils and fuel oils of heading ex 2710<br /> only, treatment by means of a high-frequency electrical brush discharge;<br /> (o) in respect of crude products (other than petroleum jelly, ozokerite, lignite wax<br /> or peat wax, paraffin wax containing by weight less than 0.75 % of oil) of<br /> heading ex 2712 only, de-oiling by fractional crystallisation.<br /> 8.3. For the purposes of headings ex 2707 and 2713, simple operations, such as cleaning,<br /> decanting, desalting, water separation, filtering, colouring, marking, obtaining a<br /> sulphur content as a result of mixing products with different sulphur contents, or any<br /> combination of these operations or like operations, do not confer origin.", "ShowProductAffected": false, "ProductAffected": null, "RevisionName": null, "Rank": 0, "ShowRooExceptions": false, "RooExceptions": null}], "SpecificNote": [{"RooCode": null, "RooText": null, "ShowProductAffected": false, "ProductAffected": null, "RevisionName": null, "Rank": 0, "ShowRooExceptions": false, "RooExceptions": null}], "Documents": [{"DocDesc": "Certificate of origin", "DocFileName": "itc00819_coo.pdf", "DocType": "1_coo", "WebLink": null}, {"DocDesc": "Product-specific rules of origin", "DocFileName": "itc00819_sroo.pdf", "DocType": "2_sroo", "WebLink": null}, {"DocDesc": "Chapter on rules of origin", "DocFileName": "itc00819_roo.pdf", "DocType": "3_roo", "WebLink": "https://ie.enterprisesg.gov.sg/~/media/IE%20Singapore/Files/FTA/FTAs/Turkey%20Singapore%20FTA/Protocol%201%20Including%20Annnexes"}, {"DocDesc": "Full text of agreement", "DocFileName": "itc00819_full.pdf", "DocType": "8_full", "WebLink": "https://ie.enterprisesg.gov.sg/~/media/IE%20Singapore/Files/FTA/FTAs/Turkey%20Singapore%20FTA/Turkey%20Legal%20Text%20-%20TRSFTA"}, {"DocDesc": "WTO notification", "DocFileName": "itc00819_wto.pdf", "DocType": "9_wto", "WebLink": "https://docs.wto.org/dol2fe/Pages/SS/directdoc.aspx?filename=q:/G/RO/N174.pdf"}]}, "FtaProvisions": {"RooProvision": [{"ProvisionAbbrev": "accum", "ProvisionCode": "Cumulation", "ProvisionValue": "cross-cumulation", "ProvisionRank": null, "ProvisionGlossary": "A provision which allows to consider goods obtained in as well as processing taking place in one FTA member country as originating in another.", "ProvisionGlossaryLink": "/en/glossary?uid=accum&returnto=gloscenter", "ProvisionLegalExtract": "Article 3 : Cumulation of Origin <br /> 1 Notwithstanding Article 2 (Originating Products), products shall be considered as <br /> originating in a Party if such products are obtained there by incorporating materials <br /> originating in the other Party, provided that the working or processing carried out <br /> goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 6 (Insufficient Working or <br /> Processing).

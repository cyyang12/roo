It is to ensure the direct shipment of goods from the country of origin to a consignee in Canada. The TBL is one single document that is issued prior to the goods beginning their journey when the carrier assumes care, custody, and control of the goods and will usually contain the following information: <br /> the identity of the exporter in the country of origin; <br /> the identity of the consignee in Canada; <br /> the identity of the carrier or agent who assumes liability for the performance of the contract; <br /> the contracted routing of the goods identifying all points of transhipment; <br /> a full description of the goods and the marks and numbers of the package; and <br /> the place and date of issue. <br /> Note: A TBL that does not include all points of transhipment may be accepted, if these are set out in related shipping documents presented with the TBL. <br /> On a case-by-case basis, an amended TBL may be accepted as proof of direct shipment where documentation errors have occurred and the amended TBL corrects an error in the original document. In such cases, the carrier must provide proof that the amended TBL reflects the actual movement of the goods as contracted when the goods began their journey.

Therefore, where goods are transported via airfreight, the house air waybill is acceptable as a TBL. <br /> Transshipment <br /> Under the LDCT treatment, goods may be transshipped through an intermediate country, provided that the conditions prescribed by section 18 of the Customs Tariff are met, as follows: <br /> they remain under customs transit control in the intermediate country; <br /> they do not undergo any operation in the intermediate country, other than unloading, reloading or splitting up of loads or any other operation required to keep the goods in good condition; <br /> they do not enter into trade or consumption in the intermediate country; and <br /> they do not remain in temporary storage in the intermediate country for a period exceeding six (6) months. <br /> For more information on shipping requirements and transshipment, please refer to departmental memorandum D11-4-4, Rules of Origin Respecting the General Preferential Tariff and Least Developed Country Tariff. <br /> [Guide to the Least Developed Country Tariff]: <br /> 74. The goods must be shipped directly on a TBL to a consignee in Canada from the beneficiary or LDC in which <br /> the goods were certified. Evidence in the form of a TBL (or a copy) showing that the goods have been shipped <br /> directly to a consignee in Canada must be presented to the CBSA upon request.

In the case of consolidated freight, where the TBL is a lengthy document covering unrelated goods, the <br /> importer may present the cargo receipt from the carrier (or a copy) in lieu of the TBL. The CBSA may request that <br /> the TBL be presented as final verification that the goods have been shipped directly to Canada. <br /> 77. On a case-by-case basis, an amended TBL may be accepted as proof of direct shipment where documentation <br /> errors have occurred and the amended TBL corrects an error in the original document. In such cases, the carrier <br /> must provide proof that the amended TBL reflects the actual movement of the goods as contracted when the goods <br /> began their journey.

Air cargo is usually transhipped in the air carrier's home country even if no transhipment is shown on the <br /> house air waybill. Therefore, where goods are transported via air freight, the house air waybill is acceptable as a <br /> TBL. <br /> Consignee <br /> 79. To fulfil the direct shipment requirement, goods must be shipped to a consignee in Canada. The consignee is <br /> the person or company, whether the importer, agent, or other party in Canada, to which goods are shipped under a <br /> TBL and is so named in the bill. In circumstances where goods are consigned @^@to order,@^@ the TBL is acceptable as <br /> evidence of direct shipment as long as the party within Canada to whom the goods are shipped is identified on the <br /> TBL, usually in the @^@Notify Party@^@ field. <br /> Memorandum D11-4-4 October 16, 2017 <br /> Transhipment <br /> 80. Transhipment through an intermediate country is permitted provided the conditions prescribed by section 18 of <br /> the Customs Tariff and section 2 of the Temporary Storage Period Regulations are met, as follows: <br /> (a) the goods remain under customs transit control in the intermediate country; <br /> (b) the goods do not undergo any operation in the intermediate country other than unloading, reloading or <br /> splitting up of loads, or any other operation required to keep the goods in good condition; <br /> (c) the goods do not enter into trade or consumption in the intermediate country; and <br /> (d) the goods do not remain in temporary storage in the intermediate country for a period exceeding six <br /> months. <br /> 81. Transhipment is the act of taking cargo out of one conveyance and loading it into another conveyance. It also <br /> includes the act of taking cargo out of one conveyance and reloading it into the same conveyance. The landing of <br /> an airplane for refuelling or docking of a ship to take on additional cargo does not constitute transhipment if the <br /> goods in question are not unloaded from the conveyance. <br /> 82.

Exporters (who may also be the producer of the goods) must apply the rules of origin contained in the Regulations, to determine the eligibility of their goods under the LDCT.  In most cases, exporters should find the Exporter's Statement of Origin easier to complete and provide than the alternate Form A. <br /> Form A (Certificate of Origin) <br /> The applicable LDCT rules of origin are explained in departmental memorandum D11-4-4 and are further detailed as origin criteria in the instructions to completing the Form A (Certificate of Origin). An excerpt of the Form A origin criteria is as follows: <br /> P for LDCT means 100% of the goods is produced in the LDC (as defined in subsection 2(1) of the Regulations); <br /> F for LDCT, means, at least 40% of the ex-factory price is produced in the LDCT beneficiary country. The existing 40% of the ex-factory price of the goods as packed for shipment to Canada may also include a value of up to 20% of the ex-factory price of the goods from countries set out in Schedule 2 of the Regulations; <br /> G for LDCT, means at least 40% of the ex-factory price was cumulatively produced in more than one LDCT beneficiary country or Canada. The existing 40% of the ex-factory price of the goods as packed for shipment to Canada may also include a value of up to 20% of the ex-factory price of the goods from countries set out in Schedule 2 of the Regulations. <br /> Exporter's Statement of Origin <br /> The same LDCT rules of origin apply when completing an Exporter's Statement of Origin, as those that would be applied if a Form A (Certificate of Origin) were to be completed.  The Exporter's Statement of Origin must be completed and signed by the exporter in the LDC in which the goods were finished. The statement may be written out on a Form CI1 (Canada Customs Invoice), a commercial invoice, or on an entirely separate document. The information required in the statement must be provided in its entirety for goods to qualify for the LDCT. <br /> If the statement is provided as a separate document from the invoice, the statement must reference the applicable invoice number(s). If the statement is for multiple invoices, the invoice numbers must be identified within the statement. A statement with an attached list of invoice numbers will not be acceptable. <br /> See Appendix C for the Form A (Certificate of Origin) or Exporter's Statement of Origin template. <br /> Form B255 (Certificate of Origin - Textile and Apparel Goods Originating in a Least Developed Country) <br /> Textile and apparel goods must be certified as entitled to the benefits of the LDCT on the Form B255 (Certificate of Origin - Textile and Apparel Goods Originating in a Least Developed Country). The rules of origin specific to textile and apparel goods are explained in departmental memorandum D11-4-4. D11-4-4 also provides guidance on the specific origin criteria under which goods must qualify, as well as detailed instructions for completing the certificate. These instructions and criteria are also available on the reverse side of the original document. An excerpt of the LDCT origin criteria for textile and apparel goods is as follows: <br /> [Guide to the Least Developed Country Tariff]: <br /> Certification Requirements - Commercial Goods <br /> General <br /> 54. Section 4 of the Proof of Origin of Imported Goods Regulations, also found in Memorandum D11-4-2, Proof <br /> of Origin of Imported Goods, outlines the requirements for the GPT and LDCT proof of origin.

However, separate invoices are not required. <br /> Proof of Origin - GPT <br /> 56. For all originating goods from GPT beneficiary countries, Form A - Certificate of Origin (refer to <br /> Appendix A) or the Exporter's Statement of Origin (refer to Appendix B) may be submitted as proof of origin. In <br /> most cases, exporters should find the Exporter's Statement of Origin easier to complete and provide than the <br /> alternate Form A. See paragraphs 59 to 64 of this memorandum for further information regarding these documents. <br /> Proof of Origin - LDCT <br /> 57. Except for originating goods of HS Chapters 50-63, either Form A - Certificate of Origin or the Exporter's <br /> Statement of Origin may be submitted as proof of origin. In most cases, exporters should find the Exporter's <br /> Statement of Origin easier to complete and provide than the alternate Form A. See paragraphs 59 to 64 of this <br /> memorandum for further information regarding these documents. <br /> 58. For originating textile and apparel goods of HS Chapters 50-63 the Certificate of Origin - Textile and Apparel <br /> Goods Originating in a Least Developed Country (Form B255) must be submitted as proof of origin. See <br /> paragraphs 65 and 66 of this memorandum for further information regarding this certificate. <br /> Form A - Certificate of Origin <br /> 59. A copy of the Generalized System of Preferences, Form A - Certificate of Origin, and the completion <br /> instructions are found in Appendix A. <br /> 60. Canada no longer requires Form A to be stamped and signed by an authority designated by the beneficiary <br /> country. Therefore, Form A no longer needs to be an original and Field No. 11 may be left blank. <br /> 61. A consignee in Canada must be identified in Field No. 2 of the Form A, to ensure that the exporter in the <br /> beneficiary or LDC certified the origin of the goods according to Canadian rules of origin. The consignee is the <br /> person or company, whether it is the importer, agent, or other party in Canada, to which goods are shipped under a <br /> Through Bill of Lading (TBL) and is so named in the bill. Where 100% of the value of the goods originates in the <br /> beneficiary or LDC, a consignee in Canada does not need to be indicated in Field No. 2 of the Form A. <br /> 62. For the GPT and LDCT, the origin criterion in Field No. 8 of Form A must be one of the following: <br /> P means wholly (100%) produced (as defined in subsection 2(1) of the Regulations) in the beneficiary or LDC; <br /> F for GPT, means, at least 60% of the ex-factory price was produced in the GPT beneficiary country; <br /> F for LDCT, means, at least 40% of the ex-factory price was produced in the LDCT country. The existing 40% <br /> of the ex-factory price of the goods as packed for shipment to Canada may also include a value of up to 20% of <br /> the ex-factory price of the goods from countries set out in Schedule 2 of the Regulations; <br /> G for GPT, means, at least 60% of the ex-factory price was cumulatively produced in more than one GPT <br /> beneficiary country or Canada; <br /> G for LDCT, means, at least 40% of the ex-factory price was cumulatively produced in more than one LDCT <br /> beneficiary country or Canada. The existing 40% of the ex-factory price of the goods as packed for shipment to <br /> Canada may also include a value of up to 20% of the ex-factory price of the goods from countries set out in <br /> Schedule 2 of the Regulations. <br /> Exporter's Statement of Origin <br /> 63. A copy of the Exporter's Statement of Origin is set out in Appendix B. It must be completed and signed by the <br /> exporter in the beneficiary or LDC in which the goods were finished. The statement may be written out on a Form <br /> CI1, Canada Customs Invoice, or a commercial invoice or provided as a separate document. The information <br /> required in the statement must be provided in its entirety for goods to qualify for the GPT or LDCT. <br /> Memorandum D11-4-4 October 16, 2017 <br /> 64. If the statement is provided as a separate document from the invoice, the statement must reference the <br /> applicable invoice number(s). If the statement is for multiple invoices, the invoice numbers must be identified <br /> within the statement. A statement with an attached list of invoice numbers will not be acceptable. <br /> Certificate of Origin - Textile and Apparel Goods Originating in a Least Developed Country <br /> (Form B255) <br /> 65.

From outside <br /> [Memorandum D11-6-8]: <br /> Guidelines and General Information <br /> Why are Verifications Conducted? <br /> 1. Verifications are used to ensure that importers comply with CBSA requirements and programs. <br /> What are the Main Objectives of Conducting a Verification? <br /> 2. Verifications are used to: <br /> (a) assess a client's compliance with CBSA administered legislation; <br /> (b) determine compliance within industry sectors; <br /> (c) conduct a review of a client's liabilities and entitlements; and <br /> (d) assess the integrity of trade data received from importers. <br /> Scope of Programs <br /> 3. Verifications carried out under the provisions of section 42.01 of the Customs Act (the Act) apply to three program areas, specifically: <br /> (a) origin (non-free trade agreement); <br /> (b) tariff classification; and <br /> (c) value for duty. <br /> Scope of Origin Program Covered <br /> 4. A verification of origin under section 42.01 of the Act may be conducted on goods imported under: <br /> (a) Most-Favoured-Nation Tariff; <br /> (b) General Preferential Tariff; <br /> (c) Commonwealth Caribbean Countries Tariff; <br /> (d) Least Developed Country Tariff; <br /> (e) Australia Trade Agreement; and <br /> (f) New Zealand Trade Agreement. <br /> Scope of Origin Program Excluded <br /> 5. A verification of origin under section 42.01 of the Act may not be conducted on goods imported under a free-trade agreement. <br /> 6. Information concerning verifications of origin on goods imported (or in some cases exported) under a free-trade agreement, can be found in Memorandum D11-4-20, Procedures for Verifications of Origin Under a Free Trade Agreement. <br /> Methods of Verification <br /> 7. Verifications can be conducted by using one or more of the following methods: <br /> (a) questionnaire; <br /> (b) verification letter; <br /> (c) verification visit; and <br /> (d) a review of any other information or articles received from an importer, owner, or person who accounted for the goods under subsection 32(1), (3), or (5) of the Act. <br /> 8. The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) will select the verification method(s) to be used for reviewing imported goods, taking into account the specific program needs and the nature of the client's activities. <br /> 9. The CBSA will decide where the verification will be conducted, whether it will be on-site, from the officer's workplace, or a combination of the two, and the program(s) to be reviewed for each client. <br /> 10. The CBSA will conduct verifications as one of the means of ensuring compliance with the legislation and regulations that the CBSA administers. <br /> Verification Questionnaire/Verification Letter <br /> 11. As part of the verification process, the CBSA may send a questionnaire or letter to the importer, owner, or person who accounted for the goods under subsection 32(1), (3), or (5) of the Act, which may identify the following: <br /> (a) start date of the verification; <br /> (b) scope of the verification (including the anticipated verification period); <br /> (c) name(s) of the verification team member(s); <br /> (d) legislative basis for the verification; and <br /> (e) a request for certain documents or information. <br /> Verification Visit <br /> 12. As part of the verification process, a verification visit may be conducted by an officer. The officer will attend the place or premises of the importer, owner of the goods, or the person who accounted for the goods under subsection 32(1), (3), or (5) of the Act to conduct that part of the verification. <br /> Verification of Other Information or Articles <br /> 13. As part of a verification, the CBSA may review any other information received from the importer, owner, or person who accounted for the goods under subsection 32(1), (3), or (5) of the Act during the verification. As well, information the CBSA may already have available (e.g., copies of Form B3-3, product information or analysis, and trade literature) may also be used in the verification process. <br /> 14. As part of the verification, the CBSA may analyze an article. This article may be something that was requested as part of the verification (e.g., a sample of a textile or a particular chemical), or it may be an article that is relevant to the verification, which the CBSA already has in its possession. <br /> Re-determination or Further Re-determination <br /> 15. Determination of origin, tariff classification and value for duty of imported goods is made under section 58 of the Act. <br /> 16. Based on the results of an audit or examination conducted under section 42.01 of the Act, a CBSA officer may, pursuant to section 59 of the Act, re-determine or further re-determine the origin, tariff classification and/or value for duty of the imported goods, at any time within four years after the date of the determination. <br /> 17. Where a correction or a refund has been filed within the last year of the four-year limit on correction period (i.e., 37th to 48th month from the import declaration), the CBSA will have five years to further re-determine the goods. Additional information is contained in the Determination, Re-determination and Further Re-determination of Origin, Tariff Classification and Value for Duty Regulations. <br /> Disclosure <br /> 18. The CBSA will ensure that verification results, and the rationale for decisions, are fully explained to the client at the end of any verification through an exit interview, at a disclosure meeting, or through written correspondence. <br /> Review and Appeal <br /> 19. For information concerning the dispute resolution process for importers who disagree with the Agency's determination, re-determination, or further re-determination of origin, tariff classification, or value for duty of goods, please refer to Memorandum D11-6-7, Importers' Dispute Resolution Process for Origin, Tariff Classification, and Value for Duty of Imported Goods. <br /> Books and Records <br /> 20. Information pertaining to the records and books that must be maintained in Canada by importers is contained in Memorandum D17-1-21, Maintenance of Records in Canada by Importers. <br /> Confidentiality <br /> 21. Information obtained as a result of a verification will be maintained in accordance with section 107 of the Act. <br /> Additional Information <br /> 22.

The disclosure of customs information may only be made pursuant to Section 107 of the Act, (Disclosure of Information). <br /> 14. In some cases, a laboratory analysis may be required; as such samples may be requested by the Appeals officer to assist in the determination of the tariff classification or origin of the goods. Please take note of the instructions below regarding the submission of hazardous samples. <br /> 15. It is best to provide as much information as possible to support your position with your Request or upon request by an officer as the determination will be made by considering the basis of the information actually presented before the Appeals officer. <br /> Tariff Classification <br /> 16. To facilitate requests concerning the Tariff Classification of goods the Request should be accompanied by the following information, (where applicable): <br /> 1. Identify the characteristics or attributes of the goods relevant to their tariff classification with respect to the aspects in point. Make appropriate references to accompanying supporting information, documentation or articles. <br /> 2.

A physical sample of the good may be submitted at the request of an officer. Physical samples can be particularly useful for those goods whose essential character is dependent on knowing the good's precise composition and/or constituent elements, or when seeing or touching a physical sample will facilitate or expedite the classification of the good. If a physical sample of the good has already been provided please submit a copy of any documentation that may have accompanied the sample. <br /> Note: Samples are not to be included with the request if the good is a perishable item, requires special handling, or is a hazardous product. These should only be provided at the request of the CBSA as these products require special handling instructions. In these instances, contact the officer handling your case who will provide instructions on how to safely provide the CBSA your hazardous or perishable samples. <br /> Value for Duty (Valuation) <br /> 17. To facilitate Requests concerning the valuation of goods, the Request should be accompanied by the following information, where applicable: <br /> 1. commercial invoices; <br /> 2. credit notes; <br /> 3. purchase order confirmations; <br /> 4. sale agreements, contracts or bills of sale; <br /> 5. letters of credit; <br /> 6. proof of payment; <br /> 7. quota agreements; <br /> 8. warranty agreements; <br /> 9. conditions of sale, for example, information relating to trade-ins; <br /> 10. agreements or written contracts (for example, transfer price agreements or pricing studies); <br /> 11. agreements to provide assists and agreements between third parties with information supporting the value and/or apportionment of the assists; <br /> 12. royalty agreements; <br /> 13. trademark agreements; <br /> 14. licence fee agreements; <br /> 15. copyright agreements; <br /> 16. evidence of freight costs; <br /> 17. details of rebates; <br /> 18. information relating to the identification of the place of direct shipment; <br /> 19. information which substantiates the transaction value of identical or similar goods; and, <br /> 20. detailed calculations indicating the applicability of the transaction value of identical goods method, the transaction value of similar goods method, the deductive method, the computed method, or the residual value method, as appropriate. <br /> 21. any other relevant document that supports the use of the valuation method claimed. <br /> Origin <br /> 18. To facilitate Requests concerning the origin or preferential tariff treatment of goods, the Request should be accompanied by the following information, where applicable: <br /> 1. if originating from a beneficiary country, a list of non-originating materials entering in the production of the good and the criteria by which they meet the requirements of the tariff treatment being applied for (if applicable); <br /> 2. proof of origin of materials as required by the regulations for the preferential tariff treatment for the goods being claimed; <br /> 3. the country where the good is finished in the form it is imported into Canada; <br /> 4. the transportation mode(s) and route used to ship the goods to Canada; <br /> 5. the identification of a consignee in Canada on a through bill of lading from the country of origin if claiming a regional value content or the net cost value for the goods, a list indicating the value of all costs included in the ex-factory price including materials, labour, factory overhead and reasonable profit, and a calculation of these costs expressed as a percentage of the ex-factory price; <br /> 6. whether the good was transhipped, and if so, through which countries, and what (if any) operations the good underwent during transhipment; <br /> 7. the tariff treatment the requester believes to be correct, and the reasons to support its rationale. <br /> 8. supporting documentation previously requested by the CBSA and that resulted in the denial of preferential tariff treatment; or alternative supporting documentation. <br /> 19. The person who signed the Certificate of Origin (exporter or producer) may also make a Request. However, proof should be provided that all duties and interest owing on the related imported goods has been paid or security satisfactory to the Minister has been given in respect of the total amount owing. The CBSA may reject any Requests if such proof is not provided for the goods at issue and will notify the exporter that those Requests have been rejected. To assist exporters or producers with their Requests, Form B226 or a letter containing the same information should be completed and provided with the Request. <br /> 20. The required information (mentioned in paragraph 19) such as the transaction, adjustment and line number of an importation, could be obtained in the following way: <br /> The exporter may contact the person who imported the goods. The importer of the goods should have a copy of the documentation filed with the original importation and in addition will be informed by way of a Canada Customs Detailed Adjustment Statement (DAS), Form B2-1, that the origin of goods in a particular importation has been re-determined or further re-determined. The importer will therefore know the line number, adjustment number, and the transaction number of the importation. <br /> Note: For information on additional requirements relating to specific tariff treatments and related origin issues please refer to the appropriate memorandum found in D11 \u2013 General Tariff Information Series <br /> Appendix B - Requests Regarding Advance Rulings on the Origin or Tariff Classification of Goods <br /> 1.

unless otherwise specified: <br> The method of calculating the cost of producing a good. The ex-factory price is calculated as the total value of: <br> materials; <br> parts; <br> factory overhead; <br> labour; <br> any other reasonable costs incurred during the normal manufacturing process, e.g., duties and taxes paid on materials imported into a beneficiary country and not refunded when the goods were exported; and <br> a reasonable profit. <br> Note: Any costs incurred subsequent to the goods leaving the factory, such as freight, loading, temporary storage, are not included in the ex-factory price calculation. <br> Fabric <br> @^@fabric@^@ means any good referred to in heading 50.07, 51.11 through 51.13, 52.08 through 52.12, 53.09 through 53.11, 54.07 through 54.08, 55.12 through 55.16, 58.01 through 58.07, 58.09 through 58.11, 59.01 through 59.11 or 60.01 through 60.06 of the List of Tariff Provisions set out in the schedule to the Customs Tariff. <br> Least Developed Country <br> A Least Developed Country (LDC) is a country or territory that is a beneficiary of the Least Developed Country Tariff. <br> Originating (good) <br> A good that satisfies the applicable rules of origin for the purposes of eligibility under a specific tariff treatment; <br> the Regulations <br> The General Preferential Tariff and Least Developed Country Tariff Rules of Origin Regulations; <br> Rules of origin <br> The rules of origin as contained in the General Preferential Tariff and Least Developed Country Tariff Rules of Origin Regulations for LDC entitlement to duty-free access to the Canadian market. <br> Yarn <br> @^@yarn@^@ means any good referred to in heading 50.04 through 50.06, 51.06 through 51.10, 52.04 through 52.07, 53.06 through 53.08, 54.01 through 54.06 or 55.08 through 55.11 of the List of Tariff Provisions set out in the schedule to the Customs Tariff. <br> The Least Developed Country Tariff <br> Products Included / Not Included <br> With few exclusions, goods imported into Canada determined to be originating in an LDC will be granted duty-free status.Under the LDCT, over-access, supply-managed dairy, poultry and egg products are excluded from duty-free and quota-free entitlement. To verify whether the LDCT applies to a certain good (i.e. a tariff item number), please consult the @^@Applicable PreferentialTariffs@^@ column of the Customs Tariff Schedule. <br> Duty-Free Access <br> The LDCT provides duty-free access into the Canadian market, to qualified imports (with proper proof of origin documentation) from LDCs. <br> Tariff Treatment <br> Eligibility under the Least Developed Country Tariff <br> To be eligible for the LDCT, goods must satisfy the legal requirements respecting: <br> the rules of origin; <br> certification of origin; and <br> direct shipment. <br> Other Tariff Treatments <br> In some cases, goods from an LDC may not qualify for duty-free status. In these situations the goods may still be eligible for the General Preferential Tariff (GPT), or Most-Favoured-Nation Tariff (MFN). <br> Tariff Treatment Codes for Least Developed Country Goods <br> Goods imported from an LDC should be accounted for under one of the following tariff treatment codes: <br> LDCT = 08 <br> GPT = 09 <br> MFN = 02 <br> For additional information on the accounting of imported goods, please refer to departmental memorandum D17-1-10, Coding of Customs Accounting Documents. <br> The Rules of Origin <br> There are two methods under which goods from an LDC may be considered entitled to the benefits of duty-free access into Canada. Under the first method, all LDCT eligible goods must qualify under a wholly produced rule or a cumulative rule, whereby the manufacturing process of an LDC good involves value-added inputs or @^@cumulations@^@ from other LDCs or Canada. <br> The second method is specific to textile and apparel goods.  Under this method, all LDCT eligible goods must qualify under a wholly produced rule or under one of the specific rules of origin, governing the country of origin of inputs and the manufacture of goods. The rule to be applied is dependent on the nature of the good exported from the LDC and whether the good is captured in Schedule 1 of the Regulations. <br> All goods that are entitled to the LDCT must be certified as originating in an LDC under one of the following rules. <br> Wholly Produced in One Least Developed Country Rule <br> A good originates in an LDC if the good is: <br> a. a mineral product extracted from the soil or the seabed of that LDC; <br> b. a vegetable product harvested in that LDC; <br> c. a live animal born and raised in that LDC; <br> d. a good obtained in that LDC from a live animal; <br> e. a good obtained from hunting or fishing in that LDC; <br> f. a good obtained from sea fishing or any other marine good taken from the sea by a vessel of that LDC; <br> g. a good produced on board a factory ship of that LDC exclusively from a good referred to in paragraph (f); <br> h. waste and scrap derived from manufacturing operations of that LDC; <br> i. a used good of that LDC imported into Canada for use only for the recovery of raw materials; or <br> j. a good produced in that LDC exclusively from a product or good referred to in any of paragraphs (a) to (h). <br> General 40% Least Developed Country Cumulative Rule <br> With the exception of those goods contained in Part A1 or B of Schedule 1 to the Regulations, all goods currently entitled to the benefits of the LDCT originate in an LDC if the value of the materials, parts or products originating outside that country, or in an undetermined location, and used in the manufacture or production of the goods is no more than 60% of the ex-factory price of the goods as packed for shipment to Canada.  In other words, at least 40% of the ex-factory price of the goods as packed for shipment to Canada must originate in one or more LDCs or in Canada. <br> To add, up to half of that 40% may include materials, parts or products originating in a country set out in Schedule 2 of the Regulations that is not an LDC. <br> As of January 1, 2015, yarns and fabrics are duty-free on an MFN basis and are now provided for under this rule.  The pre-2015 specific rules of origin pertaining to yarns and fabrics have since been repealed. <br> Specific Rules of Origin for Textile and Apparel Goods <br> Apparel <br> Goods listed in Parts A1 or A2 of Schedule 1 to the Regulations originate in an LDC if they are assembled in an LDC from fabric cut in that LDC or in Canada, or from parts knit to shape, provided that the fabric, or the parts knit to shape, are produced in: <br> a. any LDC or Canada from yarns spun or extruded in an LDC, a country set out in Schedule 2 of the Regulations,or in Canada, provided that the yarns do not undergo further processing outside an LDC, a country set out in Schedule 2 of the Regulations, or Canada, and the fabric does not undergo further processing outside an LDC or Canada; or <br> b. a country set out in Schedule 2 of the Regulations from yarns spun or extruded in an LDC, a country set out in Schedule 2 of the Regulations, or in Canada, provided that: <br> i. the yarns and fabric do not undergo further processing outside an LDC, a country set out in Schedule 2 of the Regulations, or Canada; and <br> ii. the value of any materials, including packing, that are used in the manufacture of the goods and that originate outside the LDC in which the goods are assembled is no more than 75% of the ex-factory price of the goods as packed for shipment to Canada. <br> When determining if goods set out in Part A1 or A2 of Schedule 1 to the Regulations are entitled to the LDCT by the application of paragraph 2(4)(a) or 2(4)(b) of the Regulations, only the fabric or parts knit to shape that determines the tariff classification of the good shall be considered. Any materials, parts or products such as threads, linings, interfacing, trims, zippers, buttons or fasteners may be disregarded. In the case where subparagraph 2(4)(b)(ii) of the Regulations is applied, exporters must ensure that the value of all materials, parts or products that originate outside Canada, or the LDC in which the goods are assembled, is no more than 75% of the ex-factory price of the goods as packed for shipment to Canada. <br> Made-up Textile Articles <br> Goods listed in Part B of Schedule 1 to the Regulations originate in an LDC if they are cut, or knit to shape, and sewn or otherwise assembled in the LDC from fabric produced in any LDC or in Canada from yarns spun or extruded in an LDC, a country set out in Schedule 2 of the Regulations, or in Canada, provided that the yarns do not undergo further processing outside an LDC, a country set out in Schedule 2 of the Regulations, or Canada and the fabric does not undergo further processing outside an LDC or Canada. <br> When determining if goods set out in Part B of Schedule 1 to the Regulations are entitled to the LDCT by the application of subsection 2(6) of the Regulations, only the fabric or parts knit to shape that determines the tariff classification of the good shall be considered. Any materials, parts or products such as threads, linings, interfacing, trims, zippers, buttons or fasteners may be disregarded. <br> Examples - Practical Applications of the Specific Rules of Origin <br> Origin criteria @^@A@^@ - Accumulation Rule <br> Goods entitled to the benefits of the LDCT and listed in Part A2 of Schedule 1 to the Regulations, can qualify as originating under one of the applicable rules of origin as identified in criteria A, D, E, or G. <br> Example: Wool of Yemen is combined with spandex of Hong Kong and sewing thread of India to manufacture wool socks in Yemen. Under the accumulation rule of origin criteria @^@A@^@, a textile or apparel good may contain parts and materials originating outside an LDC, a country set out in Schedule 2 of the Regulations, or Canada and valued at no more than 60% of the ex-factory price of the good as packed for shipment to Canada. The wool of Yemen origin represents 35% of the ex-factory price. The sewing thread of India and spandex of Hong Kong represents an additional 7%. The accumulation rule allows for inputs from countries set out in Schedule 2 of the Regulations, such as Hong Kong and India, to be included in the 40% originating parts and materials requirement. The 35% input of wool from Yemen combined with the 7% sewing thread and spandex input from the countries set out in Schedule 2 of the Regulations exceed the 40% minimum input requirement under the accumulation rule. The socks therefore qualify for duty-free market access under the LDCT. <br> Origin criteria @^@B@^@ - Yarn and Thread Rule <br> This criteria was repealed as of January 1, 2015.  Yarns and threads are duty-free on an MFN basis and are now provided for under the General 40% LDC Cumulative Rule.  Please refer to the section above entitled, @^@General 40% Least Developed Country Cumulative Rule@^@. <br> Origin criteria @^@C@^@ - Fabric Rule <br> This criteria was repealed as of January 1, 2015.  Fabrics are duty-free on an MFN basis and are now provided for under the General 40% LDC Cumulative Rule.  Please refer to the section above entitled, @^@General 40% Least Developed Country Cumulative Rule@^@. <br> Origin criteria @^@D@^@ - Apparel Rule 1 <br> Apparel Rule 1 applies to apparel goods listed in Parts A1 and A2 of Schedule 1 to the Regulations. <br> Goods classified as articles of apparel are required to be assembled in an LDC. The fabric used in the assembly of such articles of apparel must be cut in that LDC or in Canada. In the case where the article of apparel is assembled from parts knit to shape, those parts must be knit to shape in any LDC or in Canada. <br> The fabric, or the parts knit to shape must be produced in any LDC or in Canada from yarns spun or extruded in any LDC, a country set out in Schedule 2 of the Regulations, or in Canada. The yarns or fabric, or parts knit to shape, must not undergo any further processing outside any LDC or Canada. In the case of yarns, they must also not undergo any further processing outside of a country set out in Schedule 2 of the Regulations. <br> Example: Dresses or skirts manufactured in Mali will qualify as originating and be eligible for duty-free LDCT provided that the dresses or skirts are assembled in Mali from fabric that has been cut in Mali or in Canada. The fabric must be produced in any LDC or in Canada from yarns spun or extruded in any LDC, a country set out in Schedule 2 of the Regulations, or in Canada.  The yarns or fabric must not have undergone any further processing outside any LDC or Canada.  The yarns as well, must not have undergone any further processing outside of a country set in Schedule 2 of the Regulations. <br> It should be further noted that in respect of goods listed in Part A2 of Schedule 1 to the Regulations, the exporter (who may also be the producer) has the option of certifying the goods under this specific rule (i.e. Apparel Rule 1) or under the more general LDC cumulative rule that requires a minimum of 40% LDC input. <br> Origin criteria @^@E@^@ - Apparel Rule 2 <br> Apparel Rule 2 applies to apparel goods listed in Parts A1 and A2 of Schedule 1 to the Regulations. <br> Goods classified as articles of apparel are required to be assembled in an LDC. The fabric used in the assembly of such articles of apparel must be cut in that LDC or in Canada. In the case where the article of apparel is assembled from parts, those parts must be knit to shape in any country set out in Schedule 2 of the Regulations. <br> The fabric, or the parts knit to shape must be produced in a country set out in Schedule 2 of the Regulations from yarns spun or extruded in any LDC, a country set out in Schedule 2 of the Regulations, or in Canada. The yarns or fabric, or parts knit to shape, must not undergo any further processing outside an LDC, a country set out in Schedule 2 of the Regulations, or Canada. <br> The value of any materials, including packing, that are used in the manufacture of the goods, that originate outside the LDC in which the goods are assembled, must not be more than 75% of the ex-factory price of the goods as packed for shipment to Canada. For greater certainty, any parts, materials or inputs used in the production of the goods that have entered the commerce of any country other than an LDC or Canada lose their eligibility under LDCT.  As well, any materials used in the manufacture or production of the good that originate in Canada are deemed to have originated in the LDC where the goods are assembled. <br> Example: Those same dresses or skirts manufactured in Mali will be eligible for duty-free LDCT provided that the dresses or skirts are assembled in Mali and the fabric used in the manufacture of the dresses or skirts is produced in a country set out in Schedule 2 of the Regulations from yarns spun or extruded in an LDC, a country set out in Schedule 2 of the Regulations, or in Canada. The yarns and fabric cannot undergo further processing outside an LDC, a country set out in Schedule 2 of the Regulations, or Canada. When using fabric manufactured in a country set out in Schedule 2 of the Regulations, the value of any materials, including packing, which does not originate in Canada or the LDC where the dresses or skirts are assembled must not exceed 75% of the ex-factory price of the goods as packed for shipment to Canada. <br> It should be further noted that in respect of goods listed in Part A2 of Schedule 1 to the Regulations, the exporter (who may also be the producer) has the option of certifying the goods under this specific rule or under the more general LDC cumulative rule that requires a minimum of 40% LDC input. <br> Origin criteria @^@F@^@ - Made-Up Textile Articles Rule <br> The Made-Up Textile Articles Rule applies to those goods listed in Part B of Schedule 1 to the Regulations. Such goods must be cut, or knit to shape, and sewn or otherwise assembled in the LDC from fabric, or parts knit to shape, produced in any LDC or in Canada from yarns spun or extruded in any LDC, a country set out in Schedule 2 of the Regulations, or in Canada. <br> The yarns or fabric or parts knit to shape must not undergo any further processing outside an LDC or Canada. In the case of yarns, they must also not undergo any further processing outside of a country set out in Schedule 2 of the Regulations. <br> Example: Wool yarn is produced in Afghanistan (or in a country set out in Schedule 2 of the Regulations, or in Canada) and exported directly to Bangladesh (or another LDC or Canada), where it is further produced into wool fabric. The wool fabric is shipped directly to Lao People's Democratic Republic for further production into a good classified as @^@Made-up Textile Articles@^@. The production process of the finished good in Lao People's Democratic Republic must include cutting or knitting to shape of the fabric as well as sewing or otherwise assembling in that country. <br> Origin criteria @^@G@^@ - Wholly Produced Rule <br> In order to be eligible under the wholly produced (or wholly obtained) rule, the subject goods must not contain any foreign materials or parts sourced or originating from outside that LDC from which the goods are exported. For greater certainty, @^@wholly obtained@^@ does not mean a good purchased in an LDC. <br> Example: Consider cotton harvested in Burundi. The cotton is processed into yarn or thread in Burundi and manufactured into blankets in Burundi, and exported from Burundi to Canada. The goods are wholly obtained, produced and manufactured in Burundi. <br> For additional information regarding the LDCT Rules of Origin, please refer to departmental memorandum D11-4-4, Rules of Origin Respecting the General Preferential Tariff and Least Developed Country Tariff. <br> Certification (Proof) of Origin <br> According to section 4 of the Proof of Origin of Imported Goods Regulations, to claim the LDCT benefits, importers must declare that they have the required proof of origin in their possession:   A Form A (Certificate of Origin); an Exporter's Statement of Origin; or a Form B255 (Certificate of Origin \u2013 Textile and Apparel Goods Originating in a Least Developed Country). <br> The importer makes this declaration on Form B3-3 (Canada Customs Coding Form), by inserting Code 8 for LDCT in Field No. 14, @^@Tariff Treatment@^@. Also, the importer declaration field on Form B3-3 must be completed with the signature of the importer. For further instructions concerning Form B3-3, please refer to departmental memorandum D17-1-10 (Coding of Customs Accounting Documents). <br> The proof of origin must be presented to the CBSA upon request. Failure to do so will result in the application of MFN or an alternative, more appropriate tariff treatment and the application of Administrative Monetary Penalty C152, @^@Importer or owner of goods failed to furnish proof of origin upon request.@^@ <br> When requested by the CBSA to present the proof of origin, the importer may be required to provide a complete and accurate translation in English or French.  An importer may be requested to submit further documentation to substantiate the origin of the goods, such as bills of materials and purchase orders. <br> Appendix C of D11-4-4 may prove helpful when determining the applicable proof of origin requirements. <br> Form A (Certificate of Origin) or Exporter's Statement of Origin <br> Goods, other than textile and apparel, must be certified as entitled to the benefits of the LDCT on a Form A (Certificate of Origin) or an Exporter's Statement of Origin.  Exporters (who may also be the producer of the goods) must apply the rules of origin contained in the Regulations, to determine the eligibility of their goods under the LDCT.  In most cases, exporters should find the Exporter's Statement of Origin easier to complete and provide than the alternate Form A. <br> Form A (Certificate of Origin) <br> The applicable LDCT rules of origin are explained in departmental memorandum D11-4-4 and are further detailed as origin criteria in the instructions to completing the Form A (Certificate of Origin). An excerpt of the Form A origin criteria is as follows: <br> P for LDCT means 100% of the goods is produced in the LDC (as defined in subsection 2(1) of the Regulations); <br> F for LDCT, means, at least 40% of the ex-factory price is produced in the LDCT beneficiary country. The existing 40% of the ex-factory price of the goods as packed for shipment to Canada may also include a value of up to 20% of the ex-factory price of the goods from countries set out in Schedule 2 of the Regulations; <br> G for LDCT, means at least 40% of the ex-factory price was cumulatively produced in more than one LDCT beneficiary country or Canada. The existing 40% of the ex-factory price of the goods as packed for shipment to Canada may also include a value of up to 20% of the ex-factory price of the goods from countries set out in Schedule 2 of the Regulations. <br> Exporter's Statement of Origin <br> The same LDCT rules of origin apply when completing an Exporter's Statement of Origin, as those that would be applied if a Form A (Certificate of Origin) were to be completed.  The Exporter's Statement of Origin must be completed and signed by the exporter in the LDC in which the goods were finished. The statement may be written out on a Form CI1 (Canada Customs Invoice), a commercial invoice, or on an entirely separate document. The information required in the statement must be provided in its entirety for goods to qualify for the LDCT. <br> If the statement is provided as a separate document from the invoice, the statement must reference the applicable invoice number(s). If the statement is for multiple invoices, the invoice numbers must be identified within the statement. A statement with an attached list of invoice numbers will not be acceptable. <br> See Appendix C for the Form A (Certificate of Origin) or Exporter's Statement of Origin template. <br> Form B255 (Certificate of Origin - Textile and Apparel Goods Originating in a Least Developed Country) <br> Textile and apparel goods must be certified as entitled to the benefits of the LDCT on the Form B255 (Certificate of Origin - Textile and Apparel Goods Originating in a Least Developed Country). The rules of origin specific to textile and apparel goods are explained in departmental memorandum D11-4-4. D11-4-4 also provides guidance on the specific origin criteria under which goods must qualify, as well as detailed instructions for completing the certificate. These instructions and criteria are also available on the reverse side of the original document. An excerpt of the LDCT origin criteria for textile and apparel goods is as follows: <br> Preference Criteria <br> A The good is produced in a LDC and the value of the materials, parts or products originating outside that LDC, or in an undetermined location, and used in the manufacture or production of the good does not exceed 60% of the ex-factory price of the good as packed for shipment to Canada. For the purpose of this criterion, any materials, parts or products that originate in any other LDC or Canada may be deemed to originate in that LDC.  In addition, any materials, parts or products originating from a country set out in Schedule 2 of the Regulations and having up to 20% of the ex-factory price may be deemed to originate in that LDC. This criterion does not apply to goods listed in Part A1 or Part B of Schedule 1 to the Regulations. <br> B Repealed. <br> C Repealed. <br> D The good is listed in Part A1 or Part A2 of Schedule 1 to the Regulations and has been assembled in a LDC from fabric cut in that LDC or Canada, or from parts knit to shape, and the fabric (or parts knit to shape) has been produced in any LDC or Canada from yarns spun or extruded in a LDC, a country set out in Schedule 2 of the Regulations or Canada and the yarns or fabric have not undergone further processing outside a LDC or Canada; in addition, the yarns have not undergone further processing outside a country set out in Schedule 2 of the Regulations. Note: This criterion applies if the fabric (or parts knit to shape) is produced in any LDC or Canada. <br> E The good is listed in Part A1 or Part A2 of Schedule 1 to the Regulations and has been assembled in a LDC from fabric cut in that LDC or Canada, or from parts knit to shape, and the fabric (or parts knit to shape) has been produced in a country set out in Schedule 2 of the Regulations from yarns spun or extruded in a LDC, a country set out in Schedule 2 of the Regulations or Canada and neither the yarns nor the fabric have undergone further processing outside a LDC, a country set out in Schedule 2 of the Regulations or Canada and the value of any materials, including packing, that are used in the manufacture of the good and that originate outside the least developed country in which the good is assembled is no more than 75% of the ex-factory price of the good as packed for shipment to Canada. Any materials used in the manufacture of the good that originate in Canada are deemed to have originated in the LDC for the value calculation. Note: This criterion applies if the fabric (or parts knit to shape) is produced in a country set out in Schedule 2 of the Regulations. <br> F The good is listed in Part B of Schedule 1 to the Regulations and was cut (or knit to shape) and sewn or otherwise assembled in a LDC from fabric produced in any LDC or Canada from yarns spun or extruded in a LDC, a country set out in Schedule 2 of the Regulations or Canada and the yarns and fabric have not undergone further processing outside a LDC or Canada; in addition, the yarns have not undergone further processing outside a country set out in Schedule 2 of the Regulations. <br> G The good is 'wholly obtained or produced entirely' in the territory of the LDC. <br> For the template Form B255 (Certificate of Origin - Textile and Apparel Goods Originating in a Least Developed Country), please refer to Appendix C. <br> For ease of reference, the table below (Table 1) illustrates the applicable origin criteria for goods listed under the various Parts of Schedule 1 to the Regulations. <br> Table 1: Applicable origin criteria for textile and apparel goods <br> Applicable <br> Not applicable <br> Goods of HS Chapters 50-63 which are not listed in Schedule 1 of the Regulations <br> Origin Criteria @^@A@^@ subsection 2(3) <br> Goods as set out in the Schedule 1 to the Regulations <br> Goods <br> A1 - Apparel Goods <br> A2 - Apparel Goods <br> B - Made-up Textile Articles <br> For additional information on the Form A (Certificate of Origin) and the Form B255 (Certificate of Origin - Textile and Apparel Goods Originating in a Least Developed Country), please refer to departmental memorandum D11-4-4, Rules of Origin Respecting the General Preferential Tariff and Least Developed Country Tariff. <br> Direct Shipment Requirements <br> To be eligible for the LDCT, goods must also satisfy the following shipping requirements. <br> Shipping Requirements <br> The goods must be shipped directly on a through bill of lading (TBL) to a consignee in Canada from the LDC in which the goods were certified. Evidence in the form of a TBL (or a copy) showing that the goods have been shipped directly to a consignee in Canada must be presented to the CBSA upon request. An importer may be requested to submit further documentation to substantiate the TBL, such as sales order, report of entry documents, and cargo control documents. <br> The TBL is a contract to convey goods from one point to another. It is to ensure the direct shipment of goods from the country of origin to a consignee in Canada. The TBL is one single document that is issued prior to the goods beginning their journey when the carrier assumes care, custody, and control of the goods and will usually contain the following information: <br> the identity of the exporter in the country of origin; <br> the identity of the consignee in Canada; <br> the identity of the carrier or agent who assumes liability for the performance of the contract; <br> the contracted routing of the goods identifying all points of transhipment; <br> a full description of the goods and the marks and numbers of the package; and <br> the place and date of issue. <br> Note: A TBL that does not include all points of transhipment may be accepted, if these are set out in related shipping documents presented with the TBL. <br> On a case-by-case basis, an amended TBL may be accepted as proof of direct shipment where documentation errors have occurred and the amended TBL corrects an error in the original document. In such cases, the carrier must provide proof that the amended TBL reflects the actual movement of the goods as contracted when the goods began their journey. Documentation presented must clearly indicate the actual movement of the goods. <br> Air cargo is usually transshipped in the air carrier's home country even if no transshipment is shown on the house air waybill. Therefore, where goods are transported via airfreight, the house air waybill is acceptable as a TBL. <br> Transshipment <br> Under the LDCT treatment, goods may be transshipped through an intermediate country, provided that the conditions prescribed by section 18 of the Customs Tariff are met, as follows: <br> they remain under customs transit control in the intermediate country; <br> they do not undergo any operation in the intermediate country, other than unloading, reloading or splitting up of loads or any other operation required to keep the goods in good condition; <br> they do not enter into trade or consumption in the intermediate country; and <br> they do not remain in temporary storage in the intermediate country for a period exceeding six (6) months. <br> For more information on shipping requirements and transshipment, please refer to departmental memorandum D11-4-4, Rules of Origin Respecting the General Preferential Tariff and Least Developed Country Tariff. <br> Verification of Origin <br> Origin verifications on goods imported from an LDC will be initiated by the CBSA through the issuance of an origin verification questionnaire/letter to the exporter/producer of the goods that is the subject of the verification. <br> The exporter/producer will complete the questionnaire or respond to the verification letter as directed and return the completed document(s) to the CBSA. An origin auditor will review the document(s) and determine, based on the information provided, whether the goods meet the requirements of the rules of origin, do not meet the requirements or if additional information is required. <br> If it is determined that the goods do not meet the requirements of the rules of origin, a CBSA official will issue a @^@Notice of Intent to Deny@^@. This will serve as notice to the exporter/producer that the goods do not qualify for the LDCT. The goods at issue will be determined dutiable at the next most beneficial rate of duty - either the GPT or the MFN. This entitlement will depend on the eligibility of the goods and the proof of origin requirements that are available to the customs officer(s). Note that the Form A (Certificate of Origin) or an Exporter's Statement of Origin is a requirement for entitlement to the GPT. <br> If the origin auditor determines that an on-site visit is required, they may issue a notification of intent to visit the premises of the exporter/producer. As well, the on-site visit notification will be sent to the designated official of the country in which the exporter/producer is located. <br> If the exporter/producer consents to the on-site visit, a verification team will visit the premises of the exporter/producer to perform an origin verification of the goods under review. Upon completion of the on-site visit, the CBSA will issue a preliminary report to the exporter/producer, outlining the results of the visit. <br> Upon review of the information in Canada and at the conclusion of the origin audit, the CBSA will issue a final report detailing the findings under the audit. This report will be sent to the exporter/producer, with a notice of decision on the status of the goods vis-\u00e0-vis duty-free LDCT entitlement. <br> Additional Information <br> For more information, within Canada call the Border Information Service at 1-800-461-9999. From outside Canada call 204-983-3500 or 506-636-5064. Long distance charges will apply. Agents are available Monday to Friday (08: 00 \u2013 16: 00 local time / except holidays). TTY is also available within Canada: 1-866-335-3237. <br> Appendix A - List of Countries Entitled to the Least Developed Country Tariff <br> Please refer to the following CBSA webpage: List of Countries and Applicable Tariff Treatments. <br> Appendix B - General Preferential Tariff and Least Developed Country Tariff Rules of Origin Regulations (LDCT-Specific Rules) <br> For the complete Regulations, please refer to the following Department of Justice webpage: General Preferential Tariff and Least Developed Country Tariff Rules of Origin Regulations. <br> As of January 1, 2015, the sections, subsections and schedules relevant to the LDCT are as follows: <br> Section 1 definitions for @^@fabric@^@, least developed country@^@ and @^@yarn@^@; <br> Section 2 subsections 2(1), 2(3) to 2(7), and 2(9); <br> Section 3; <br> Section 4 subsection 4(2); <br> Schedule 1 and Schedule 2. <br> Appendix C - Templates for Certification (Proof) of Origin <br> Form A (Certificate of Origin) or Exporter's Statement of Origin (template) <br> For the Form A (Certificate of Origin), please refer to Appendix A of departmental memorandum D11-4-4, Rules of Origin Respecting the General Preferential Tariff and Least Developed Country Tariff. <br> For the Exporter's Statement of Origin template, please refer to Appendix B of departmental memorandum D11-4-4, Rules of Origin Respecting the General Preferential Tariff and Least Developed Country Tariff. <br> Form B255 (Certificate of Origin \u2013 Textile and Apparel Goods Originating in a Least Developed Country) (template) <br> For the Form B255, Certificate of Origin \u2013 Textile and Apparel Goods Originating in a Least Developed Country, please refer to the following CBSA webpage: Form B255. <br> 3.   The @^@Interpretation@^@ section of the General Preferential Tariff and Least Developed Country Tariff Rules of <br> Origin Regulations (the Regulations) contains definitions that are important in understanding the administration of <br> the Regulations. For purposes of this memorandum, the following terms are also important: <br> Ex-factory price <br> Means the total value of: (a) materials; (b) parts; (c) factory overhead; (d) labour; (e) any other reasonable costs <br> incurred during the normal manufacturing process, e.g. duties and taxes paid on materials imported into a <br> beneficiary country and not refunded when the goods were exported; and (f) a reasonable profit. [Note: Any costs <br> incurred subsequent to the goods leaving the factory, such as freight, loading, temporary storage, are not included <br> in the ex-factory price calculation.] <br> HS <br> Means the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System that is used for the classification of goods. <br> Paragraph <br> Means a subset of a subsection to the Regulations (for example: paragraph 2(1)(a) is one of the definitions used to <br> determine if a good originates from a GPT or LDCT beneficiary country). <br> Section <br> Means a portion of the Regulations (for example: Section 4 pertains to Direct Shipment). <br> Subsection <br> Means a subset of a section to the Regulations (for example subsection 2(1) defines goods as wholly obtained or <br> produced). <br> Product Coverage <br> 4.   The applicable GPT rates of duty appear in the Customs Tariff Schedule. Goods for which a GPT rate is not <br> indicated are not entitled to a GPT rate of duty but rather are subject to an alternate tariff treatment, usually the <br> Most-Favoured-Nation Tariff (MFN). In addition, handicrafts from GPT beneficiary countries that meet the criteria <br> outlined in Memorandum D10-15-13, Handicrafts, may benefit from duty-free treatment. <br> 5.   The applicable LDCT rates of duty accorded to goods are identified in the Customs Tariff Schedule. Where an <br> LDCT rate is not indicated, the goods in question are not entitled to the LDCT treatment, but rather are usually <br> subject to the alternate GPT or MFN treatment. <br> Methods of Determining Country of Origin <br> General <br> 6.   The country of origin of goods imported from a GPT or LDCT beneficiary is determined using the rules of <br> origin set out in sections 2 through 4 of the Regulations. <br> Rules of Origin for GPT <br> 7.   To determine if goods are entitled to the GPT, only subsections 2(1), 2(2) and 2(8), in addition to sections 1, 3 <br> and 4 of the Regulations may be applied. <br> GPT - Application of Subsection 2(1) <br> 8.   A good is @^@wholly obtained or produced@^@ in a GPT beneficiary if it meets one of the definitions set out in <br> subsection 2(1) of the Regulations. @^@Wholly obtained@^@ does not mean a good purchased in a GPT beneficiary. <br> Goods, which are @^@wholly obtained or produced@^@ in a GPT beneficiary, must not contain any foreign materials or <br> parts from outside that GPT beneficiary. <br> Example: Sugar cane grown and harvested in Pakistan would meet the definition of paragraph 2(1)(b) of the <br> Regulations. <br> Example: Leather belts are produced in Egypt. They are made from leather wholly produced from cattle born <br> and raised in Egypt. Therefore the belts are wholly produced in Egypt by the application of paragraph 2(1)(j). <br> Memorandum D11-4-4 October 16, 2017 <br> GPT - Application of Subsections 2(2) and 2(8) <br> 9.   To qualify for the GPT treatment by the application of subsection 2(2) of the Regulations, a maximum 40% of <br> the ex-factory price of the good as packed for shipment to Canada, may originate outside a GPT beneficiary or <br> Canada. (i.e. at least 60% of the ex-factory price of the good as packed for shipment to Canada must originate in <br> one or more GPT beneficiary countries or Canada.) <br> Example: A radio receiver subassembly is produced in Cambodia from imported parts. The receiver <br> subassembly is then exported to the Philippines, where it is manufactured with other imported materials into a <br> finished radio. As both countries are GPT beneficiary countries, the value of the materials and work done in <br> Cambodia may be added to the work done in the Philippines to determine whether the radio meets the 60% <br> originating content requirement. <br> Example: Insulated wire is manufactured in Bolivia. The materials used include steel from Canada, rubber <br> from C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, and Bolivian materials and labour costs. To determine whether the wire meets the <br> qualifying content requirement, the value of the Canadian steel may be added to the content originating from <br> the GPT beneficiary countries. <br> "}]}, {"ArticleType": "Memorandum D11-6-8", "Articles": [{"ArticleTitle": "No article title", "ArticleDesc": "Guidelines and General Information <br> Why are Verifications Conducted? <br> 1. Verifications are used to ensure that importers comply with CBSA requirements and programs. <br> What are the Main Objectives of Conducting a Verification? <br> 2. Verifications are used to: <br> (a) assess a client's compliance with CBSA administered legislation; <br> (b) determine compliance within industry sectors; <br> (c) conduct a review of a client's liabilities and entitlements; and <br> (d) assess the integrity of trade data received from importers. <br> Scope of Programs <br> 3. Verifications carried out under the provisions of section 42.01 of the Customs Act (the Act) apply to three program areas, specifically: <br> (a) origin (non-free trade agreement); <br> (b) tariff classification; and <br> (c) value for duty. <br> Scope of Origin Program Covered <br> 4. A verification of origin under section 42.01 of the Act may be conducted on goods imported under: <br> (a) Most-Favoured-Nation Tariff; <br> (b) General Preferential Tariff; <br> (c) Commonwealth Caribbean Countries Tariff; <br> (d) Least Developed Country Tariff; <br> (e) Australia Trade Agreement; and <br> (f) New Zealand Trade Agreement. <br> Scope of Origin Program Excluded <br> 5. A verification of origin under section 42.01 of the Act may not be conducted on goods imported under a free-trade agreement. <br> 6. Information concerning verifications of origin on goods imported (or in some cases exported) under a free-trade agreement, can be found in Memorandum D11-4-20, Procedures for Verifications of Origin Under a Free Trade Agreement. <br> Methods of Verification <br> 7. Verifications can be conducted by using one or more of the following methods: <br> (a) questionnaire; <br> (b) verification letter; <br> (c) verification visit; and <br> (d) a review of any other information or articles received from an importer, owner, or person who accounted for the goods under subsection 32(1), (3), or (5) of the Act. <br> 8. The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) will select the verification method(s) to be used for reviewing imported goods, taking into account the specific program needs and the nature of the client's activities. <br> 9. The CBSA will decide where the verification will be conducted, whether it will be on-site, from the officer's workplace, or a combination of the two, and the program(s) to be reviewed for each client. <br> 10. The CBSA will conduct verifications as one of the means of ensuring compliance with the legislation and regulations that the CBSA administers. <br> Verification Questionnaire/Verification Letter <br> 11. As part of the verification process, the CBSA may send a questionnaire or letter to the importer, owner, or person who accounted for the goods under subsection 32(1), (3), or (5) of the Act, which may identify the following: <br> (a) start date of the verification; <br> (b) scope of the verification (including the anticipated verification period); <br> (c) name(s) of the verification team member(s); <br> (d) legislative basis for the verification; and <br> (e) a request for certain documents or information. <br> Verification Visit <br> 12. As part of the verification process, a verification visit may be conducted by an officer. The officer will attend the place or premises of the importer, owner of the goods, or the person who accounted for the goods under subsection 32(1), (3), or (5) of the Act to conduct that part of the verification. <br> Verification of Other Information or Articles <br> 13. As part of a verification, the CBSA may review any other information received from the importer, owner, or person who accounted for the goods under subsection 32(1), (3), or (5) of the Act during the verification. As well, information the CBSA may already have available (e.g., copies of Form B3-3, product information or analysis, and trade literature) may also be used in the verification process. <br> 14. As part of the verification, the CBSA may analyze an article. This article may be something that was requested as part of the verification (e.g., a sample of a textile or a particular chemical), or it may be an article that is relevant to the verification, which the CBSA already has in its possession. <br> Re-determination or Further Re-determination <br> 15. Determination of origin, tariff classification and value for duty of imported goods is made under section 58 of the Act. <br> 16. Based on the results of an audit or examination conducted under section 42.01 of the Act, a CBSA officer may, pursuant to section 59 of the Act, re-determine or further re-determine the origin, tariff classification and/or value for duty of the imported goods, at any time within four years after the date of the determination. <br> 17. Where a correction or a refund has been filed within the last year of the four-year limit on correction period (i.e., 37th to 48th month from the import declaration), the CBSA will have five years to further re-determine the goods. Additional information is contained in the Determination, Re-determination and Further Re-determination of Origin, Tariff Classification and Value for Duty Regulations. <br> Disclosure <br> 18. The CBSA will ensure that verification results, and the rationale for decisions, are fully explained to the client at the end of any verification through an exit interview, at a disclosure meeting, or through written correspondence. <br> Review and Appeal <br> 19.

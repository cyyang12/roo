First two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column gives the heading<br /> number or chapter number used in the Harmonised System and the second column gives the<br /> description of goods used in that system for that heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two<br /> columns a rule is specified in columns 3 or 4. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is<br /> preceded by an \u2018ex', this signifies that the rules in columns 3 or 4 apply only to the part of that<br /> heading as described in column 2.<br /> 2. Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number is given and<br /> the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rules in<br /> columns 3 or 4 apply to all products which, under the Harmonised System, are classified in headings<br /> of the chapter or in any of the headings grouped together in column 1.<br /> 3. Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each<br /> indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rules in columns 3<br /> or 4.<br /> 4. Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns 3 and 4, the<br /> exporter may opt, as an alternative, to apply either the rule set out in column 3 or that set out in<br /> column 4. If no origin rule is given in column 4, the rule set out in column 3 has to be applied.<br /> Note 3:<br /> 1. The provisions of Article 5 of this Protocol concerning products having acquired originating status<br /> which are used in the manufacture of other products apply regardless of whether this status has been<br /> acquired inside the factory where these products are used or in another factory in the United Kingdom<br /> or in Cameroon.<br /> Example:<br /> An engine of heading No 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-originating<br /> materials which may be incorporated may not exceed 40 per cent of the ex-works price, is made from<br /> \u2018other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging' of heading No ex 7224.<br /> If this forging has been forged in the United Kingdom from a non-originating ingot, it has already<br /> acquired originating status by virtue of the rule for heading No ex 7224 in the list. The forging can<br /> then count as originating in the value calculation for the engine regardless of whether it was produced<br /> in the same factory or in another factory in the United Kingdom. The value of the non-originating<br /> ingot is thus not taken into account when adding up the value of the non-originating materials used.<br /> 2. The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing required and the<br /> carrying out of more working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the carrying<br /> out of less working or processing cannot confer originating status. This if a rule provides that non-<br /> originating material at a certain level of manufacture may be used, the use of such material at an<br /> earlier stage of manufacture is allowed and the use of such material at a later stage is not.<br /> 3. Without prejudice to Note 3.2 where a rule states that \u2018materials of any heading' may be used,<br /> materials of the same heading as the product may also be used, subject, however, to any specific<br /> limitations which may also be contained in the rule. However, the expression \u2018manufacture from<br /> materials of any heading, including other materials of heading No ...' means that only materials<br /> classified in the same heading as the product of a different description than that of the product as<br /> given in column 2 of the list may be used.<br /> 4. When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one material,<br /> this means that any one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all be used.<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for fabrics of heading Nos 5208 to 5212 provides that natural fibres may be used and those<br /> chemical materials, among other materials, may also be used. This does not mean that both have to be<br /> used; it is possible to use one or the other or both.<br /> 5. Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular material, the<br /> condition obviously does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their inherent<br /> nature, cannot satisfy the rule. (See also Note 6.3 below in relation to textiles).<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for prepared foods of heading No 1904 which specifically excludes the use of cereals and<br /> their derivatives does not prevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and other additives which are not<br /> products from cereals.<br /> However, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be manufactured from the<br /> particular materials specified in the list, can be produced from a material of the same nature at an<br /> earlier stage of manufacture.<br /> Example:<br /> In the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 made from non-woven materials, if the use of<br /> only non-originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is not possible to start from non-woven<br /> cloth \u2014 even if non-woven cloths cannot normally be made from yarn. In such cases, the starting<br /> material would normally be at the stage before yarn \u2014 that is the fibre stage.<br /> 6. Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of non-originating<br /> materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be added together. In other words, the<br /> maximum value of all the non-originating materials used may never exceed the highest of the<br /> percentages given. Furthermore, the individual percentages must not be exceeded in relation to the<br /> particular materials they apply to.<br /> Note 4:<br /> 1. The term \u2018natural fibres' is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic fibres.<br /> It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless otherwise<br /> specified, includes fibres that have been carded, combed or otherwise processed but not spun.<br /> 2. The term \u2018natural fibres' includes horsehair of heading No 0503, silk of heading Nos 5002 and<br /> 5003 as well as the wool fibres, fine or coarse animal hair of heading Nos 5101 to 5105, the cotton<br /> fibres of heading Nos 5201 to 5203 and the other vegetable fibres of heading Nos 5301 to 5305.<br /> 3. The terms \u2018textile pulp', \u2018chemical materials' and \u2018paper-making materials' are used in the list to<br /> describe the materials not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to manufacture artificial,<br /> synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.<br /> 4. The term \u2018man-made staple fibres' is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament tow,<br /> staple fibres or waste, of heading Nos 5501 to 5507.<br /> Note 5:<br /> 1. Where for a given product in the list a reference is made to this note, the conditions set out in<br /> column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials, used in the manufacture of this product,<br /> which, taken together, represent 10 per cent or less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials<br /> used. (See also Notes 5.3 and 5.4 below).<br /> 2. However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 5.1 may only be applied to mixed products which have<br /> been made from two or more basic textile materials.<br /> The following are the basic textile materials:<br /> \u2014 silk,<br /> \u2014 wool,<br /> \u2014 coarse animal hair,<br /> \u2014 fine animal hair,<br /> \u2014 horsehair,<br /> \u2014 cotton,<br /> \u2014 paper-making materials and paper,<br /> \u2014 flax,<br /> \u2014 true hemp,<br /> \u2014 jute and other textile baste fibres,<br /> \u2014 sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave,<br /> \u2014 coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made filaments,<br /> \u2014 artificial man-made filaments,<br /> \u2014 current conducting filaments,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyphenylene sulphide,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyvinyl chloride,<br /> \u2014 other synthetic man-made staple fibres,<br /> \u2014 artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose,<br /> \u2014 other artificial man-made staple fibres,<br /> \u2014 yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether whether or not gimped,<br /> \u2014 yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester whether or not gimped,<br /> \u2014 products of heading 5605 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core of aluminium<br /> foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not<br /> exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of<br /> plastic film,<br /> \u2014 other products of heading 5605.<br /> Example:<br /> A yarn of heading No 5205 made from cotton fibres of heading No 5203 and synthetic staple fibres of<br /> heading No 5506 is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres that do not satisfy<br /> the origin rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) may be used up<br /> to a weight of 10 per cent of the yarn.<br /> Example:<br /> A woollen fabric of heading No 5112 made from woollen yarn of heading No 5107 and synthetic yarn<br /> of staple fibres of heading No 5509 is a mixed fabric. Therefore synthetic yarn which does not satisfy<br /> the origin rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) or woollen yarn<br /> that does not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from natural fibres, not carded or<br /> combed or otherwise prepared for spinning) or a combination of the two may be used provided their<br /> total weight does not exceed 10 per cent of the weight of the fabric.<br /> Example:<br /> Tufted textile fabric of heading No 5802 made from cotton yarn of heading No 5205 and cotton fabric<br /> of heading No 5210 is only a mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric being made<br /> from yarns classified in two separate headings or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.<br /> Example:<br /> If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading No 5205 and<br /> synthetic fabric of heading No 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic textile<br /> materials and the tufted textile fabric is accordingly a mixed product.<br /> 3. In the case of products incorporating \u2018yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments<br /> of polyether whether or not gimped' this tolerance is 20 per cent in respect of this yarn.<br /> 4. In the case of products incorporating \u2018strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of<br /> plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm,<br /> sandwiched by means of an adhesive between two layers of plastic film', this tolerance is 30 per cent<br /> in respect of this strip.<br /> Note 6:<br /> 1. In the case of those textile products, which are marked in the list by a footnote referring to this<br /> Introductory Note, textile trimmings and accessories which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in<br /> column 3 for the made up products concerned may be used provided that their weight does not exceed<br /> 10 % of the total weight of all the textile materials incorporated.<br /> Textile trimmings and accessories are those classified in Chapters 50 to 63. Linings and interlinings<br /> are not being regarded as trimmings or accessories.<br /> 2. Any non-textile trimmings and accessories or other materials used which contain textiles do not<br /> have to satisfy the conditions set out in column 3 even though they fall outside the scope of Note 3.5.<br /> 3. In accordance with Note 3.5, any non-originating non-textile trimmings and accessories or other<br /> product, which do not contain any textiles, may anyway, be used freely where they cannot be made<br /> from the materials listed in column 3.<br /> For example(1), if a rule in the list says that for a particular textile item, such as a blouse, yarn must<br /> be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because they cannot be made<br /> from textile materials.<br /> 4. Where a percentage rule applies, the value of trimmings and accessories must be taken into account<br /> when calculating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.<br /> Note 7:<br /> 1.For the purposes of heading Nos ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex 3403, the \u2018specific<br /> processes' are the following:<br /> (a) vacuum distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process (2) ;<br /> (c) cracking;<br /> (d) reforming;<br /> (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f)the process comprising all the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid,<br /> oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification<br /> with naturally active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;<br /> (g) polymerisation;<br /> (h) alkylation;<br /> (i) isomerisation.<br /> 2.For the purposes of heading Nos 2710 to 2712, the \u2018specific processes' are the following:<br /> (a) vacuum distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process (2)_;<br /> (c) cracking;<br /> (d) reforming;<br /> (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f)the process comprising all the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid,<br /> oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification<br /> with naturally active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;<br /> (g) polymerisation;<br /> (h) alkylation;<br /> (i) isomerisation;<br /> (j)in respect of heavy oils falling within heading No ex 2710 only, desulphurisation with hydrogen<br /> resulting in a reduction of at least 85 % of the sulphur content of the products processed (ASTM<br /> D 1266-59 T method);<br /> (k)in respect of products falling within heading No 2710 only, deparaffining by a process other than<br /> filtering;<br /> (l)in respect of heavy oils falling within heading No ex 2710 only, treatment with hydrogen at a<br /> pressure of more than 20 bar and a temperature of more than 250 \u00b0C with the use of a catalyst, other<br /> than to effect desulphurisation, when the hydrogen constitutes an active element in a chemical<br /> reaction. The further treatment with hydrogen of lubricating oils of heading No ex 2710 (e.g.<br /> hydrofinishing or decolourisation) in order, more especially, to improve colour or stability shall<br /> not, however, be deemed to be a specific process;<br /> (m)in respect of fuel oils falling within heading No ex 2710 only, atmospheric distillation, on<br /> condition that less than 30 % of those products distils, by volume, including losses, at 300 \u00b0C by<br /> the ASTM D 86 method;<br /> (n)in respect of heavy oils other than gas oils and fuel oils falling within heading No ex 2710 only,<br /> treatment by means of a high-frequency electrical brush-discharge.<br /> 3.For the purposes of heading Nos ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex 3403, simple<br /> operations such as cleaning, decanting, desalting, water separation, filtering, colouring, marking,<br /> obtaining a sulphur content as a result of mixing products with different sulphur contents, any<br /> combination of those operations or like operations do not confer origin.<br /> (1) This example is given for the purpose of explanation only.

However, the value of such non-originating materials shall be included when<br /> calculating the value of non-originating materials and under no circumstances may the percentage for the maximum value of<br /> non-originating materials as set out in the rule be exceeded through the use of the de minimis provision.<br /> 4.

In this particular instance, only the value of any other non-originating<br /> materials that are used in the production of the final good and that satisfy the required change in tariff classification set out in<br /> the rule of this Annex would need to be taken into account when calculating the value of non-originating materials for<br /> purposes of determining the origin of the final good.<br /> 6.

A written notice of intent to deny preferential tariff treatment issued pursuant to paragraph 15 shall provide for no less than 30 days during which the exporter or producer of the good may provide, with regard to that determination, written comments or additional information that will be taken into account by the Party prior to completing the verification. <br /> 17.

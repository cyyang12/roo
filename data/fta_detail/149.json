The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column gives the<br /> heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonised System and the second column<br /> gives the description of goods used in that system for that heading or chapter. For each entry<br /> in the first two columns a rule is specified in columns 3 or 4. Where, in some cases, the entry<br /> in the first column is preceded by an \"ex\", this signifies that the rules in columns 3 or 4 apply<br /> only to the part of that heading as described in column 2.<br /> 2. Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number is<br /> given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the<br /> adjacent rules in columns 3 or 4 apply to all products which, under the Harmonised System,<br /> are classified in headings of the chapter or in any of the headings grouped together in<br /> column 1.<br /> 3. Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each<br /> indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rules in<br /> columns 3 or 4.<br /> 4. Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns 3 and 4, the<br /> exporter may opt, as an alternative, to apply either the rule set out in column 3 or that set out<br /> in column 4. If no origin rule is given in column 4, the rule set out in column 3 has to<br /> be applied.<br /> Note 3:<br /> 1. The provisions of Article 8 of this Protocol concerning products having acquired originating<br /> status which are used in the manufacture of other products apply regardless of whether this<br /> status has been acquired inside the factory where these products are used or in another factory<br /> in the EU or in the SADC EPA States.<br /> Example:<br /> An engine of heading No 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-originating<br /> materials which may be incorporated may not exceed 40 per cent of the ex-works price, is<br /> made from \"other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging\" of heading No ex 7224.<br /> If this forging has been forged in the EU from a non-originating ingot, it has already acquired<br /> originating status by virtue of the rule for heading No ex 7224 in the list. The forging can then<br /> count as originating in the value calculation for the engine regardless of whether it was<br /> produced in the same factory or in another factory in the EU. The value of the non-originating<br /> ingot is thus not taken into account when adding up the value of the non-originating<br /> materials used.<br /> 2. The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing required and the<br /> carrying out of more working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the<br /> carrying out of less working or processing cannot confer originating status. Therefore, if a<br /> rule provides that non-originating material at a certain level of manufacture may be used, the<br /> use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed and the use of such material<br /> at a later stage is not.<br /> 3. Without prejudice to Note 3.2 where a rule states that \"materials of any heading\" may be<br /> used, materials of the same heading as the product may also be used, subject, however, to any<br /> specific limitations which may also be contained in the rule. However, the expression<br /> \"manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of heading No ..<br /> means that only materials classified in the same heading as the product of a different<br /> description than that of the product as given in column 2 of the list may be used.<br /> 4. When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one<br /> material, this means that any one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all<br /> be used.<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for fabrics of heading Nos 5208 to 5212 provides that natural fibres may be used and<br /> that chemical materials, among other materials, may also be used. This does not mean that<br /> both have to be used; it is possible to use one or the other or both.<br /> 5. Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular<br /> material, the condition obviously does not prevent the use of other materials which, because<br /> of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule. (See also Note 6.3 below in relation to<br /> textiles).<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for prepared foods of heading No 1904 which specifically excludes the use of<br /> non-originating cereals and their derivatives does not prevent the use of mineral salts,<br /> chemicals and other additives which are not products from cereals.<br /> However, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be manufactured from<br /> the particular materials specified in the list, can be produced from a material of the same<br /> nature at an earlier stage of manufacture.<br /> Example:<br /> In the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 made from non-woven materials, if the<br /> use of only non-originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is not possible to start<br /> from non-woven cloth - even if non-woven cloths cannot normally be made from yarn. In<br /> such cases, the starting material would normally be at the stage before yarn - that is the<br /> fibre stage.<br /> 6. Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of<br /> non-originating materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be added together.<br /> In other words, the maximum value of all the non-originating materials used may never<br /> exceed the highest of the percentages given. Furthermore, the individual percentages must not<br /> be exceeded in relation to the particular materials they apply to.<br /> Note 4:<br /> 1. The term \"natural fibres\" is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic<br /> fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless<br /> otherwise specified, includes fibres that have been carded, combed or otherwise processed but<br /> not spun.<br /> 2. The term \"natural fibres\" includes horsehair of heading No 0503, silk of heading Nos 5002<br /> and 5003 as well as the wool fibres, fine or coarse animal hair of heading Nos 5101 to 5105,<br /> the cotton fibres of heading Nos 5201 to 5203 and the other vegetable fibres of heading<br /> Nos 5301 to 5305.<br /> 3. The terms \"textile pulp\", \"chemical materials\" and \"paper-making materials\" are used in the<br /> list to describe the materials not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to<br /> manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.<br /> 4. The term \"man-made staple fibres\" is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament<br /> tow, staple fibres or waste, of heading Nos 5501 to 5507.<br /> Note 5:<br /> 1. Where for a given product in the list a reference is made to this note, the conditions set out in<br /> column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials, used in the manufacture of this<br /> product, which, taken together, represent 10 per cent or less of the total weight of all the basic<br /> textile materials used. (See also Notes 5.3 and 5.4 below).<br /> 2. However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 5.1 may only be applied to mixed products which<br /> have been made from two or more basic textile materials.<br /> The following are the basic textile materials:<br /> - silk,<br /> - wool,<br /> - coarse animal hair,<br /> - fine animal hair,<br /> - horsehair,<br /> - cotton,<br /> - paper-making materials and paper,<br /> - flax,<br /> - true hemp,<br /> - jute and other textile bast fibres,<br /> - sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave,<br /> - coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,<br /> - synthetic man-made filaments,<br /> - artificial man-made filaments,<br /> - current conducting filaments,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyphenylene sulphide,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyvinyl chloride,<br /> - other synthetic man-made staple fibres,<br /> - artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose,<br /> - other artificial man-made staple fibres,<br /> - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether<br /> whether or not gimped,<br /> - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester whether<br /> or not gimped,<br /> - products of heading No 5605 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a<br /> core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with<br /> aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a<br /> transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film,<br /> - other products of heading No 5605.<br /> Example:<br /> A yarn of heading No 5205 made from cotton fibres of heading No 5203 and synthetic staple<br /> fibres of heading No 5506 is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres<br /> that do not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or<br /> textile pulp) may be used up to a weight of 10 per cent of the yarn.<br /> Example:<br /> A woollen fabric of heading No 5112 made from woollen yarn of heading No 5107 and<br /> synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading No 5509 is a mixed fabric. Therefore synthetic yarn<br /> which does not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or<br /> textile pulp) or woollen yarn that does not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture<br /> from natural fibres, not carded or combed or otherwise prepared for spinning) or a<br /> combination of the two may be used provided their total weight does not exceed 10 per cent<br /> of the weight of the fabric.<br /> Example:<br /> Tufted textile fabric of heading No 5802 made from cotton yarn of heading No 5205 and<br /> cotton fabric of heading No 5210 is only a mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed<br /> fabric being made from yarns classified in two separate headings or if the cotton yarns used<br /> are themselves mixtures.<br /> Example:<br /> If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading No 5205 and<br /> synthetic fabric of heading No 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic<br /> textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is accordingly a mixed product.<br /> 3. In the case of products incorporating \"yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible<br /> segments of polyether whether or not gimped\" this tolerance is 20 per cent in respect of<br /> this yarn.<br /> 4. In the case of products incorporating \"strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core<br /> of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm,<br /> sandwiched by means of an adhesive between two layers of plastic film\", this tolerance is<br /> 30 per cent in respect of this strip.<br /> Note 6:<br /> 1. In the case of those textile products, which are marked in the list by a footnote referring to this<br /> Introductory Note, textile trimmings and accessories which do not satisfy the rule set out in<br /> the list in column 3 for the made up products concerned may be used provided that their<br /> weight does not exceed 10 % of the total weight of all the textile materials incorporated.<br /> Textile trimmings and accessories are those classified in Chapters 50 to 63. Linings and<br /> interlinings are not to be regarded as trimmings or accessories.<br /> 2. Any non-textile trimmings and accessories or other materials used which contain textiles do<br /> not have to satisfy the conditions set out in column 3 even though they fall outside the scope<br /> of Note 3.5.<br /> 3. In accordance with Note 3.5, any non-originating non-textile trimmings and accessories or<br /> other product, which do not contain any textiles, may, anyway, be used freely where they<br /> cannot be made from the materials listed in column 3.<br /> For example9, if a rule in the list says that for a particular textile item, such as a blouse, yarn<br /> must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because they<br /> cannot be made from textile materials.<br /> 4. Where a percentage rule applies, the value of trimmings and accessories must be taken into<br /> account when calculating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.<br /> Note 7:<br /> 1. For the purposes of heading Nos ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex 3403, the<br /> \"specific processes\" are the following:<br /> (a) vacuum distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;<br /> This example is given for the purpose of explanation only.

The further treatment with<br /> hydrogen of lubricating oils of heading No ex 2710 (e.g. hydrofinishing or<br /> decolourisation) in order, more especially, to improve colour or stability shall not,<br /> however, be deemed to be a specific process;<br /> (m) in respect of fuel oils falling within heading No ex 2710 only, atmospheric distillation,<br /> on condition that less than 30 per

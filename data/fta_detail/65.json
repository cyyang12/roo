or <br /> (ii) at a cost that is less than the normal market value of the <br /> materials; and <br /> (b) that the receipt of the materials free of charge or at a reduced <br /> cost has been arranged, directly or indirectly, by a person <br /> who will be the importer of preference claim goods in which <br /> those materials are incorporated; <br /> the Comptroller-General of Customs may, by written notice given <br /> to the importer, require that an amount determined by the <br /> Comptroller-General of Customs to be the difference between the <br /> cost, if any, paid by the manufacturer and the normal market value <br /> be treated as the amount, or a part of the amount, paid by the <br /> manufacturer in respect of the materials. <br /> Effect of determination <br /> (7) If the Comptroller-General of Customs gives a notice to the <br /> importer of preference claim goods under subsection (4), (5) or (6) <br /> in respect of materials incorporated in those goods, the cost of the <br /> materials to the manufacturer must be determined having regard to <br /> the terms of that notice. <br /> 153F Allowable expenditure of factory on labour <br /> Calculation of allowable expenditure of factory on labour <br /> (1) Allowable expenditure of a factory on labour in respect of <br /> preference claim goods means the sum of the part of each cost <br /> prescribed for the purposes of this subsection: <br /> (a) that is incurred by the manufacturer of the goods; and <br /> (b) that relates, directly or indirectly, and wholly or partly, to the <br /> manufacture of the goods; and <br /> (c) that can reasonably be allocated to the manufacture of the <br /> goods. <br /> The duties Part VIII <br /> Regulations may specify manner of working out cost <br /> (2) Regulations prescribing a cost for the purposes of subsection (1) <br /> may also specify the manner of working out that cost. <br /> 153G Allowable expenditure of factory on overheads <br /> Calculation of allowable expenditure of factory on overheads <br /> (1) Allowable expenditure of a factory on overheads in respect of <br /> preference claim goods means the sum of the part of each cost <br /> prescribed for the purposes of this subsection: <br /> (a) that is incurred by the manufacturer of the goods; and <br /> (b) that relates, directly or indirectly, and wholly or partly, to the <br /> manufacture of the goods; and <br /> (c) that can reasonably be allocated to the manufacture of the <br /> goods. <br /> Regulations may specify manner of working out cost <br /> (2) Regulations prescribing a cost for the purposes of subsection (1) <br /> may also specify the manner of working out that cost. <br /> 153H Unmanufactured goods <br /> Goods claimed to be the produce of a country are the produce of <br /> that country if they are its unmanufactured raw products. <br /> 153L Manufactured goods originating in Papua New Guinea or a <br /> Forum Island Country <br /> Rule for certain goods wholly manufactured in Papua New Guinea <br /> (1) Goods claimed to be the manufacture of Papua New Guinea are the <br /> manufacture of that country if they are wholly manufactured in <br /> Papua New Guinea from one or more of the following: <br /> (a) unmanufactured raw products; <br /> (b) materials wholly manufactured in Australia or Papua New <br /> Guinea or Australia and Papua New Guinea; <br /> (c) materials imported into Papua New Guinea that the <br /> Comptroller-General of Customs has determined, by Gazette <br /> notice, to be manufactured raw materials of Papua New <br /> Guinea. <br /> Rule for manufactured goods last processed in PNG or a Forum <br /> Island Country <br /> (2) Goods claimed to be the manufacture of Papua New Guinea or of a <br /> Forum Island Country are the manufacture of that country if: <br /> (a) the last process in their manufacture was performed in that <br /> country; and <br /> (b) having regard to their qualifying area, their allowable factory <br /> cost is not less than the specified percentage of their total <br /> factory cost. <br /> Specified percentage <br /> (4) The specified percentage of the total factory cost of goods referred <br /> to in subsection (2) is: <br /> (a) unless paragraph (b) applies-50%; or <br /> (b) if the goods are of a kind for which the Comptroller-General <br /> of Customs has determined, by Gazette notice, that a lesser <br /> percentage is appropriate-that percentage. <br /> 153LA Modification of section 153L in special circumstances <br /> When 50% in subsection 153L(4) can be read as 48% <br /> (1) If the Comptroller-General of Customs is satisfied: <br /> (a) that the allowable factory cost of preference claim goods in a <br /> shipment of such goods that are claimed to be the <br /> manufacture of Papua New Guinea or a Forum Island <br /> Country is at least 48% but not 50% of the total factory cost <br /> of those goods; and <br /> The duties Part VIII <br /> (b) that the allowable factory cost of those goods would be at <br /> least 50% of the total factory cost of those goods if an <br /> unforeseen circumstance had not occurred; and <br /> (c) that the unforeseen circumstance is unlikely to continue; <br /> the Comptroller-General of Customs may determine, in writing, <br /> that section 153L has effect: <br /> (d) for the purpose of the shipment of goods that is affected by <br /> that unforeseen circumstance;

Overview of Part <br> (1) This Part deals with the taking of anti-dumping measures in respect <br> of goods whose importation into Australia involves a dumping or <br> countervailable subsidisation of

Those measures might <br> consist of the publication of a dumping duty notice or a <br> countervailing duty notice or the acceptance of an undertaking on <br> conditions that make it unnecessary to publish such a notice. <br> (2) If a notice is published, that notice creates a liability under the <br> Dumping Duty Act, in relation to any goods to which the notice <br> extends, to pay a special duty of customs on their importation into <br> Australia and, pending assessment of that special duty, to pay <br> interim duty. <br> (2A) Division 1A deals with the establishment of the Anti-Dumping <br> Commission and the Commissioner. <br> (3) Divisions 1, 2 and 3 deal with the preliminary and procedural <br> matters leading to a Ministerial decision to publish or not to <br> publish a dumping duty notice or a countervailing duty notice or to <br> accept an undertaking instead of publishing such a notice. <br> (4) Division 4 allows a person who has been required to pay interim <br> duty to seek an assessment of duty payable under the Dumping <br> Duty Act and reconciles interim duty paid by that person with duty <br> as so assessed. <br> (5) Division 5 deals with the rights of persons, periodically, on the <br> basis of changed circumstances, to seek review by the Minister of <br> decisions to publish dumping duty notices or countervailing duty <br> notices or to accept undertakings. <br> Part XVB Special provisions relating to anti-dumping duties <br> (5A) Division 5A deals with the rights of persons to ask the <br> Commissioner to conduct an anti-circumvention inquiry in relation <br> to certain dumping duty notices or countervailing duty notices. <br> (6) Division 6 deals with the rights of new exporters to seek an early <br> review by the Minister of decisions to publish dumping duty <br> notices or countervailing duty notices. <br> (7) Division 6A ensures that interested parties are informed of the <br> impending expiration of anti-dumping measures and allows them <br> to seek continuation of those measures. <br> (8) Division 7 deals with procedural and evidentiary matters that are <br> relevant both to applications for the taking of anti-dumping <br> measures and for the various review procedures after such <br> measures are taken. <br> (9) Divisions 8 and 9 establish an independent panel, the Review <br> Panel, and provide for the Panel to review a range of Ministerial <br> decisions (including decisions to publish or not to publish dumping <br> duty notices or countervailing duty notices) and also a range of <br> decisions made by the Commissioner. <br> Special provisions relating to anti-dumping duties Part XVB <br> Anti-Dumping Commission and Commissioner Division 1A <br> Division 1A—Anti-Dumping Commission and <br> Commissioner <br> Subdivision A—Preliminary <br> "},{"ArticleTitle":"69SMA What this Division is about","ArticleDesc":"269SMA What this Division is about <br> • This Division establishes the Anti-Dumping Commission <br> within the Department. <br> • There is to be a Commissioner of the Anti-Dumping <br> Commission.

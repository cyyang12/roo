have been so entered during such calendar year if <br> the limitations under subsection (c)(2)(A) of this section applied. <br> (5) Effective period of waiver <br> Any waiver granted under this

By early 1997, that <br> presence had been reduced by half to seven professionals in only four countries. <br> (3) Since 1997, the Department of Commerce has slowly begun to increase the presence <br> of the Commercial Service in sub-Saharan Africa, adding five full-time officers to <br> established posts. <br> (4) Although the Commercial Service Officers in these countries have regional <br> responsibilities, this kind of coverage does not adequately service the needs of United <br> States businesses attempting to do business in sub-Saharan Africa. <br> (5) The Congress has, on several occasions, encouraged the Commercial Service to focus <br> its resources and efforts in countries or regions in Europe or Asia to promote greater <br> United States export activity in those markets, and similar encouragement should be <br> provided for countries in sub-Saharan Africa as well. <br> (6) Because market information is not widely available in many sub-Saharan African <br> countries, the presence of additional Commercial Service Officers and resources can play <br> a significant role in assisting United States businesses in markets in those countries. <br> (b) APPOINTMENTS- Subject to the availability of appropriations, by not later than December 31, <br> 2001, the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Assistant Secretary of Commerce and <br> Director General of the United States and Foreign Commercial Service, shall take steps to ensure <br> that-- <br> (1) at least 20 full-time Commercial Service employees are stationed in sub-Saharan <br> Africa; and <br> (2) full-time Commercial Service employees are stationed in not less than 10 different <br> sub-Saharan African countries. <br> (c) INITIATIVE FOR SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA- In order to encourage the export of United <br> States goods and services to sub-Saharan African countries, the International Trade Administration <br> shall make a special effort to-- <br> (1) identify United States goods and services which are the best prospects for export by <br> United States companies to sub-Saharan Africa; <br> (2) identify, where appropriate, tariff and nontariff barriers that are preventing or <br> hindering sales of United States goods and services to, or the operation of United States <br> companies in, sub-Saharan Africa; <br> (3) hold discussions with appropriate authorities in sub-Saharan Africa on the matters <br> described in paragraphs (1) and (2) with a view to securing increased market access for <br> United States exporters of goods and services; <br> (4) identify current resource allocations and personnel levels in sub-Saharan Africa for <br> the Commercial Service and consider plans for the deployment of additional resources or <br> personnel to that region; and <br> (5) make available to the public, through printed and electronic means of communication, <br> the information derived pursuant to paragraphs (1) through (4) for each of the 4 years <br> after the date of the enactment of this Act. <br> "}, {"ArticleTitle": "SEC. 126.

The African Development Foundation has worked successfully to <br> enhance the role of women as agents of change, strengthen the informal sector with an <br> emphasis on supporting micro and small sized enterprises, indigenous technologies, and <br> mobilizing local financing.

<br> (4) Apparel articles wholly assembled in one or more beneficiary countries from fabric wholly formed in one or more beneficiary countries from yarns originating in the United States or one or more beneficiary countries or former beneficiary countries, or both (including fabrics not formed from yarns, if those fabrics are classifiable under heading 5602 or 5603 of the HTSUS and are wholly formed in one or more beneficiary countries), or from components knit-to-shape in one or more beneficiary countries from yarns originating in the United States or one or more beneficiary countries or former beneficiary countries, or both, or apparel articles wholly formed on seamless knitting machines in a beneficiary country from yarns originating in the United States or one or more beneficiary countries or former beneficiary countries, or both, whether or not the apparel articles are also made from any of the fabrics, fabric components formed, or components knit-to-shape described in paragraph (a)(1), (2) or (3) of this section (unless the apparel articles are made exclusively from any of the fabrics, fabric components formed, or components knit-to-shape described in paragraph (a)(1), (2), or (3) of this section), subject to the applicable quantitative limit published in the Federal Register pursuant to U.S. Note 2, Subchapter XIX, Chapter 98, HTSUS; <br> (5) Apparel articles wholly assembled, or knit to shape and wholly assembled, or both, in one or more lesser developed beneficiary countries regardless of the country of origin of the fabric or the yarn used to make the articles, subject to the applicable quantitative limit published in the Federal Register pursuant to U.S. Note 2, Subchapter XIX, Chapter 98, HTSUS; <br> (6) Sweaters, in chief weight of cashmere, knit-to-shape in one or more beneficiary countries and classifiable under subheading 6110.12 of the HTSUS; <br> (7) Sweaters, containing 50 percent or more by weight of wool measuring 21.5 microns in diameter or finer, knit-to-shape in one or more beneficiary countries; <br> (8) Apparel articles, other than brassieres classifiable under subheading 6212.10, HTSUS, that are both cut (or knit-to-shape) and sewn or otherwise assembled in one or more beneficiary countries, provided that the apparel articles would be considered an originating good under General Note 12(t) HTSUS, without regard to the source of the fabric or yarn of which the articles are made, if the apparel articles had been imported directly from Canada or Mexico; <br> (9) Apparel articles that are both cut (or knit-to-shape) and sewn or otherwise assembled in one or more beneficiary countries from fabrics or yarn that the President or his designee has designated in the Federal Register as not available in commercial quantities in the United States;

Dyeing, printing and other finishing operations do not constitute part of a yarn or fabric or component formation process. Those operations may be performed on any yarn (including sewing thread) or fabric or knit-to-shape or other component used in the production of any article described under paragraph (a) of this section without affecting the eligibility of the article for preferential treatment, provided that the operation is performed in the United States or in a beneficiary country and not in any other country. However, in the case of an assembled article described in paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section, a dyeing, printing or other finishing operation may be performed in a beneficiary country without affecting the eligibility of the article for preferential treatment only if that operation is incidental to the assembly process. <br> (2) Other operations. An article described under paragraph (a) of this section that is otherwise eligible for preferential treatment will not be disqualified from receiving that treatment by virtue of having undergone one or more operations such as embroidering, stone-washing, enzyme-washing, acid washing, perma-pressing, oven-baking, bleaching, garment-dyeing or screen printing, provided that the operation is performed in the United States or in a beneficiary country and not in any other country. However, in the case of an assembled article described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, an operation may be performed in a beneficiary country without affecting the eligibility of the article for preferential treatment only if it is incidental to the assembly process. <br> (c) Special rules for certain component materials\u2014(1) General. An article otherwise described under paragraph (a) of this section will not be ineligible for the preferential treatment referred to in \u00a710.211 because the article contains: <br> (i) Findings and trimmings of foreign origin, if the value of those findings and trimmings does not exceed 25 percent of the cost of the components of the assembled article. For purposes of this section @^@findings and trimmings@^@ include, but are not limited to, hooks and eyes, snaps, buttons, @^@bow buds,@^@ decorative lace trim, elastic strips (but only if they are each less than 1 inch in width and are used in the production of brassieres), zippers (including zipper tapes), labels, and sewing thread except in the case of an article described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section; <br> (ii) Interlinings of foreign origin, if the value of those interlinings does not exceed 25 percent of the cost of the components of the assembled article. For purposes of this section @^@interlinings@^@ include only a chest type plate, a @^@hymo@^@ piece, or @^@sleeve header,@^@ of woven or weft-inserted warp knit construction and of coarse animal hair or man-made filaments; <br> (iii) Any combination of findings and trimmings of foreign origin and interlinings of foreign origin, if the total value of those findings and trimmings and interlinings does not exceed 25 percent of the cost of the components of the assembled article; <br> (iv) Fibers or yarns not wholly formed in the United States or one or more beneficiary countries or former beneficiary countries if the total weight of all those fibers and yarns is not more than 10 percent of the total weight of the article; or <br> (v) Any collars or cuffs (cut or knit-to-shape), drawstrings, shoulder pads or other padding, waistbands, belt attached to the article, straps containing elastic, or elbow patches that do not meet the requirements set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, regardless of the country of origin of the applicable component referred to in this paragraph. <br> (2) @^@Cost@^@ and @^@value@^@ defined. The @^@cost@^@ of components and the @^@value@^@ of findings and trimmings or interlinings referred to in paragraph (c)(1) of this section means: <br> (i) The ex-factory price of the components, findings and trimmings or interlinings as set out in the invoice or other commercial documents, or, if the price is other than ex-factory, the price as set out in the invoice or other commercial documents adjusted to arrive at an ex-factory price; or <br> (ii) If the price cannot be determined under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section or if that price is unreasonable, all reasonable expenses incurred in the growth, production, manufacture or other processing of the components, findings and trimmings, or interlinings, including the cost or value of materials and general expenses, plus a reasonable amount for profit. <br> (3) Treatment of fibers and yarns as findings or trimmings. If any fibers or yarns not wholly formed in the United States or one or more beneficiary countries are used in an article as a finding or trimming described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the fibers or yarns will be considered to be a finding or trimming for purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section. <br> (d) Imported directly defined. For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the words @^@imported directly@^@ mean: <br> (1) Direct shipment from any beneficiary country to the United States without passing through the territory of any non-beneficiary country; <br> (2) If the shipment is from any beneficiary country to the United States through the territory of any non-beneficiary country, the articles in the shipment do not enter into the commerce of any non-beneficiary country while en route to the United States and the invoices, bills of lading, and other shipping documents show the United States as the final destination; or <br> (3) If the shipment is from any beneficiary country to the United States through the territory of any non-beneficiary country, and the invoices and other documents do not show the United States as the final destination, the articles in the shipment upon arrival in the United States are imported directly only if they: <br> (i) Remained under the control of the customs authority of the intermediate country; <br> (ii) Did not enter into the commerce of the intermediate country except for the purpose of sale other than at retail, and the Center director is satisfied that the importation results from the original commercial transaction between the importer and the producer or the producer's sales agent; and <br> (iii) Were not subjected to operations other than loading or unloading, and other activities necessary to preserve the articles in good condition. <br> \u00a710.214\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Certificate of Origin. <br> (a) General.

In connection with a claim for preferential treatment for a textile or apparel article described in \u00a710.213, the importer must make a written declaration that the article qualifies for that treatment. The inclusion on the entry summary, or equivalent documentation, of the subheading within Chapter 98 of the HTSUS under which the article is classified will constitute the written declaration. Except in any of the circumstances described in \u00a710.216(d)(1), the declaration required under this paragraph must be based on an original Certificate of Origin that has been completed and properly executed in accordance with \u00a710.214, that covers the article being imported, and that is in the possession of the importer. <br> (b) Corrected declaration. If, after making the declaration required under paragraph (a) of this section, the importer has reason to believe that a Certificate of Origin on which a declaration was based contains information that is not correct, the importer must within 30 calendar days after the date of discovery of the error make a corrected declaration and pay any duties that may be due. A corrected declaration will be effected by submission of a letter or other written statement to the CBP port where the declaration was originally filed. <br> \u00a710.216\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Maintenance of records and submission of Certificate by importer. <br> (a) Maintenance of records. Each importer claiming preferential treatment for an article under \u00a710.215 must maintain, in accordance with the provisions of part 163 of this chapter, all records relating to the importation of the article. Those records must include the original Certificate of Origin referred to in \u00a710.215(a) and any other relevant documents or other records as specified in \u00a7163.1(a) of this chapter. <br> (b) Submission of Certificate. An importer who claims preferential treatment on a textile or apparel article under \u00a710.215(a) must provide, at the request of the Center director, a copy of the Certificate of Origin pertaining to the article. A Certificate of Origin submitted to CBP under this paragraph: <br> (1) Must be in writing or must be transmitted electronically pursuant to any electronic data interchange system authorized by CBP for that purpose; <br> (2) Must be signed by the exporter or producer or by the exporter's or producer's authorized agent having knowledge of the relevant facts; <br> (3) Must be completed either in the English language or in the language of the country from which the article is exported. If the Certificate is completed in a language other than English, the importer must provide to CBP upon request a written English translation of the Certificate; and <br> (4) May be applicable to: <br> (i) A single importation of an article into the United States, including a single shipment that results in the filing of one or more entries and a series of shipments that results in the filing of one entry; or <br> (ii) Multiple importations of identical articles into the United States that occur within a specified blanket period, not to exceed 12 months, set out in the Certificate by the exporter. For purposes of this paragraph and \u00a710.214(c)(15), @^@identical articles@^@ means articles that are the same in all material respects, including physical characteristics, quality, and reputation. <br> (c) Correction and nonacceptance of Certificate. If the Center director determines that a Certificate of Origin is illegible or defective or has not been completed in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, the importer will be given a period of not less than five working days to submit a corrected Certificate. A Certificate will not be accepted in connection with subsequent importations during a period referred to in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section if the Center director determined that a previously imported identical article covered by the Certificate did not qualify for preferential treatment. <br> (d) Certificate not required\u2014(1) General. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, an importer is not required to have a Certificate of Origin in his possession for: <br> (i) An importation of an article for which the Center director has in writing waived the requirement for a Certificate of Origin because the Center director is otherwise satisfied that the article qualifies for preferential treatment; <br> (ii) A non-commercial importation of an article; or <br> (iii) A commercial importation of an article whose value does not exceed US $2,500, provided that, unless waived by the Center director, the producer, exporter, importer or authorized agent includes on, or attaches to, the invoice or other document accompanying the shipment the following signed statement: <br> I hereby certify that the article covered by this shipment qualifies for preferential treatment under the AGOA. <br> Check One: <br> (\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0) Producer <br> (\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0) Exporter <br> (\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0) Importer <br> (\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0) Agent <br> Name <br> Title <br> Address <br> Signature and Date <br> (2) Exception. If the Center director determines that an importation described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section forms part of a series of importations that may reasonably be considered to have been undertaken or arranged for the purpose of avoiding a Certificate of Origin requirement under \u00a7\u00a710.214 through 10.216, the Center director will notify the importer in writing that for that importation the importer must have in his possession a valid Certificate of Origin to support the claim for preferential treatment. The importer will have 30 calendar days from the date of the written notice to obtain a valid Certificate of Origin, and a failure to timely obtain the Certificate of Origin will result in denial of the claim for preferential treatment. For purposes of this paragraph, a @^@series of importations@^@ means two or more entries covering articles arriving on the same day from the same exporter and consigned to the same person. <br> \u00a710.217\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Verification and justification of claim for preferential treatment. <br> (a) Verification by CBP. A claim for preferential treatment made under \u00a710.215, including any statements or other information contained on a Certificate of Origin submitted to CBP under \u00a710.216, will be subject to whatever verification the Center director deems necessary. In the event that the Center director for any reason is prevented from verifying the claim, the Center director may deny the claim for preferential treatment. A verification of a claim for preferential treatment may involve, but need not be limited to, a review of: <br> (1) All records required to be made, kept, and made available to CBP by the importer or any other person under part 163 of this chapter; <br> (2) Documentation and other information regarding the country of origin of an article and its constituent materials, including, but not limited to, production records, information relating to the place of production, the number and identification of the types of machinery used in production, and the number of workers employed in production; and <br> (3) Evidence to document the use of U.S. materials in the production of the article in question, such as purchase orders, invoices, bills of lading and other shipping documents, and customs import and clearance documents. <br> (b) Importer requirements. In order to make a claim for preferential treatment under \u00a710.215, the importer: <br> (1) Must have records that explain how the importer came to the conclusion that the textile or apparel article qualifies for preferential treatment. Those records must include documents that support a claim that the article in question qualifies for preferential treatment because it is specifically described in one of the provisions under \u00a710.213(a).

The provisions of 10.171, 10.173, and 10.175 through 10.178 will apply for <br> purposes of duty-free treatment under this section. However, application of those provisions in the context <br> of this section will be subject to the following rules: (1) The term beneficiary developing country, wherever <br> it appears, means beneficiary sub-Saharan African country;' (2) In the GSP declaration set forth in <br> 10.173(a)(1)(i), the column heading Materials produced in a beneficiary developing country or members of <br> the same association should read Material produced in a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country or in the <br> U.S.; (3) The provisions of 10.175(c) will not apply; and (4) For purposes of determining compliance with <br> the 35 percent value content requirement set forth in 10.176(a): (i) An amount not to exceed 15 percent of <br> the appraised value of the article at the time it is entered may be attributed to the cost or value of materials <br> produced in the customs territory of the United States, and the provisions of 10.177 will apply for purposes <br> of identifying materials produced in the customs territory of the United States and the cost or value of those <br> materials; and (ii) The cost or value of materials included in the article that are produced in more than one <br> beneficiary sub-Saharan African country may be applied without regard to whether those countries are <br> members of the same association of countries. <br> (e) Importer requirements. In order to make a claim for duty-free treatment under this section, the importer: <br> (1) Must have records that explain how the importer came to the conclusion that the article qualifies for <br> duty-free treatment; (2) Must have records that demonstrate that the importer is claiming that the article <br> qualifies for duty-free treatment because it is the growth of a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country or <br> because it is the product of a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country or because it is the manufacture of a <br> beneficiary sub-Saharan African country. If the importer is claiming that the article is the growth of a <br> beneficiary sub-Saharan African country, the importer must have records that indicate that the product was <br> grown in that country, such as a record of receipt from a farmer whose crops are grown in that country. If <br> the importer is claiming that the article is the product of, or the manufacture of, a beneficiary sub-Saharan <br> African country, the importer must have records that indicate that the manufacturing or processing <br> operations reflected in or applied to the article meet the country of origin rules set forth in 10.176(a) and <br> paragraph (d) of this section.

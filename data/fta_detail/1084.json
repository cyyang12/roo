The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column gives the heading<br /> number or chapter number used in the Harmonised System and the second column gives the<br /> description of goods used in that system for that heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two<br /> columns a rule is specified in columns 3 or 4. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is<br /> preceded by an \u2018ex', this signifies that the rules in columns 3 or 4 apply only to the part of that<br /> heading as described in column 2.<br /> 2.2. Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number is given and<br /> the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rules in<br /> columns 3 or 4 apply to all products which, under the Harmonised System, are classified in headings<br /> of the chapter or in any of the headings grouped together in column 1.<br /> 2.3 Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each indent<br /> contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rules in columns 3<br /> or 4.<br /> 2.4. Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns 3 and 4, the<br /> exporter may opt, as an alternative, to apply either the rule set out in column 3 or that set out in<br /> column 4. If no origin rule is given in column 4, the rule set out in column 3 has to be applied.<br /> Note 3:<br /> 3.1. The provisions of Article 5 of the Protocol concerning products having acquired originating status<br /> which are used in the manufacture of other products apply regardless of whether this status has been<br /> acquired inside the factory where these products are used or in another factory in the Community or<br /> in Turkey.<br /> 3.2. The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing required and the<br /> carrying out of more working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the carrying<br /> out of less working or processing cannot confer originating status. Thus if a rule provides that<br /> non-originating material at a certain level of manufacture may be used, the use of such material at an<br /> earlier stage of manufacture is allowed and the use of such material at a later stage is not.<br /> 3.3. Without prejudice to Note 3.2 where a rule states that \u2018materials of any heading' may be used,<br /> materials of the same heading as the product may also be used, subject, however, to any specific<br /> limitations which may also be contained in the rule. However, the expression \u2018manufacture from<br /> materials of any heading, including other materials of heading No . . .,' means that only materials<br /> classified in the same heading as the product of a different description than that of the product as<br /> given in column 2 of the list may be used.<br /> 3.4. When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one material,<br /> this means that any one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all be used.<br /> 3.5. Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular material, the<br /> condition obviously does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their inherent<br /> nature, cannot satisfy the rule.<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for prepared foods of heading No 1904 which specifically excludes the use of cereals and<br /> their derivatives does not prevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and other additives which are<br /> not products from cereals.<br /> However, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be manufactured from the<br /> particular material specified in the list, can be produced from a material of the same nature at an<br /> earlier stage of manufacture.", "ShowProductAffected": false, "ProductAffected": null, "RevisionName": null, "Rank": 0, "ShowRooExceptions": false, "RooExceptions": null}], "SpecificNote": [{"RooCode": null, "RooText": null, "ShowProductAffected": false, "ProductAffected": null, "RevisionName": null, "Rank": 0, "ShowRooExceptions": false, "RooExceptions": null}], "Documents": [{"DocDesc": "Certificate of origin", "DocFileName": "itc01115_coo.pdf", "DocType": "1_coo", "WebLink": null}, {"DocDesc": "Product-specific rules of origin", "DocFileName": "itc01115_sroo.pdf", "DocType": "2_sroo", "WebLink": null}, {"DocDesc": "Chapter on rules of origin", "DocFileName": "itc01115_roo.pdf", "DocType": "3_roo", "WebLink": "https://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar:ce879541-5055-43da-b1d8-e885e9c8104a.0008.02/DOC_4&format=PDF"}, {"DocDesc": "Chapter on origin procedures", "DocFileName": "itc01115_proo.pdf", "DocType": "4_proo", "WebLink": null}, {"DocDesc": "Full text of agreement", "DocFileName": "itc01115_full.pdf", "DocType": "8_full", "WebLink": "https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.1998.086.01.0001.01.ENG"}]}, "FtaProvisions": {"RooProvision": [{"ProvisionAbbrev": "accum", "ProvisionCode": "Cumulation", "ProvisionValue": "cross-cumulation", "ProvisionRank": null, "ProvisionGlossary": "A provision which allows to consider goods obtained in as well as processing taking place in one FTA member country as originating in another.", "ProvisionGlossaryLink": "/en/glossary?uid=accum&returnto=gloscenter", "ProvisionLegalExtract": "Article 3 : Bilateral cumulation of origin <br /> 1.

There are four different types of rule,<br /> which vary according to the product:<br /> (a) through working or processing a maximum content of non-originating materials<br /> is not exceeded;<br /> (b) through working or processing the 4-digit Harmonized System heading or the 6-<br /> digit Harmonized System sub-heading of the manufactured products becomes<br /> different from the 4-digit Harmonized System heading or the 6-digit<br /> sub-heading respectively of the materials used;<br /> (c) a specific working and processing operation is carried out; and<br /> (d) working or processing is carried out on certain wholly obtained materials.<br /> Note 2 - The structure of the list<br /> 2.1. The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column<br /> gives the heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonized System<br /> and the second column gives the description of goods used in that system for<br /> that heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns, a rule is<br /> specified in column 3. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is<br /> preceded by an \"ex\", this signifies that the rules in column 3 apply only to the<br /> part of that heading as described in column 2.<br /> 2.2. Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter<br /> number is given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given<br /> in general terms, the adjacent rules in column 3 apply to all products which,<br /> under the Harmonized System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in<br /> any of the headings grouped together in column 1.<br /> 2.3. Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a<br /> heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered<br /> by the adjacent rules in column 3.<br /> 2.4. Where two alternative rules are set out in column 3, separated by \"or\", it is at<br /> the choice of the exporter which one to use.<br /> Note 3 - Examples of how to apply the rules<br /> 3.1. Article 5 (Sufficiently Worked or Processed Products) of the Protocol,<br /> concerning products having acquired originating status which are used in the<br /> manufacture of other products, shall apply, regardless of whether this status has<br /> been acquired inside the factory where these products are used or in another<br /> factory in a Party.<br /> 3.2. Pursuant to Article 6 (Insufficient Working or Processing) of the Protocol, the<br /> working or processing carried out must go beyond the list of operations<br /> mentioned in that Article. If it does not, the goods shall not qualify for the<br /> granting of the benefit of preferential tariff treatment, even if the conditions set<br /> out in the list below are met.<br /> Subject to the provision referred to in the first sub-paragraph, the rules in the list<br /> represent the minimum amount of working or processing required, and the<br /> carrying-out of more working or processing also confers originating status;<br /> conversely, the carrying-out of less working or processing cannot confer<br /> originating status.<br /> Thus, if a rule provides that non-originating material, at a certain level of<br /> manufacture, may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of<br /> manufacture is allowed, and the use of such material at a later stage is not.<br /> If a rule provides that non-originating material, at a certain level of<br /> manufacture, may not be used, the use of materials at an earlier stage of<br /> manufacture is allowed, and the use of materials at a later stage is not.<br /> Example: when the list-rule for Chapter 19 requires that \"non-originating<br /> materials of headings 1101 to 1108 cannot exceed 20 per cent weight\", the use<br /> (i.e. importation) of cereals of Chapter 10 (materials at an earlier stage of<br /> manufacture) is not limited.<br /> 3.3. Without prejudice to Note 3.2, where a rule uses the expression \"Manufacture<br /> from materials of any heading\", then materials of any heading(s) (even materials<br /> of the same description and heading as the product) may be used, subject,<br /> however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in the rule.<br /> The expression \"Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other<br /> materials of heading ...\" or \"Manufacture from materials of any heading,<br /> including other materials of the same heading as the product\" means that<br /> materials of any heading(s) may be used, except those of the same description<br /> as the product as given in column 2 of the list.<br /> 3.4. When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more<br /> than one material, this means that one or more materials may be used. It does<br /> not require that all be used.<br /> 3.5. Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a<br /> particular material, the rule does not prevent the use of other materials which,<br /> because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy this condition.<br /> 3.6. Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of<br /> non-originating materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be<br /> added together. In other words, the maximum value of all the non-originating<br /> materials used may never exceed the higher of the percentages given.<br /> Furthermore, the individual percentages must not be exceeded, in relation to the<br /> particular materials to which they apply.<br /> Note 4 - General provisions concerning certain agricultural goods<br /> 4.1. Agricultural goods falling within Chapters 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and heading 2401<br /> which are grown or harvested in the territory of a beneficiary country shall be<br /> treated as originating in the territory of that country, even if grown from seeds,<br /> bulbs, rootstock, cuttings, grafts, shoots, buds, or other live parts of plants<br /> imported from another country.<br /> 4.2. In cases where the content of non originating sugar in a given product is subject<br /> to limitations, the weight of sugars of headings 1701 (sucrose) and 1702 (e.g.,<br /> fructose, glucose, lactose, maltose, isoglucose or invert sugar) used in the<br /> manufacture of the final product and used in the manufacture of the non-<br /> originating products incorporated in the final product is taken into account for<br /> the calculation of such limitations.<br /> Note 5 - Terminology used in respect of certain textile products<br /> 5.1. The term \"natural fibres\" is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial<br /> or synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place,<br /> including waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres which have<br /> been carded, combed or otherwise processed, but not spun.<br /> 5.2. The term \"natural fibres\" includes horsehair of heading 0511, silk of<br /> headings 5002 and 5003, as well as wool-fibres and fine or coarse animal hair of<br /> headings 5101 to 5105, cotton fibres of headings 5201 to 5203, and other<br /> vegetable fibres of headings 5301 to 5305.<br /> 5.3. The terms \"textile pulp\", \"chemical materials\" and \"paper-making materials\" are<br /> used in the list to describe the materials, not classified in Chapters 50 to 63,<br /> which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.<br /> 5.4. The term \"man-made staple fibres\" is used in the list to refer to synthetic or<br /> artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of headings 5501 to 5507.<br /> Note 6 - Tolerances applicable to products made of a mixture of textile materials<br /> 6.1. Where, for a given product in the list, reference is made to this Note, the<br /> conditions set out in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials<br /> used in the manufacture of this product and which, taken together, represent<br /> 10 % or less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also<br /> Notes 6.3 and 6.4).<br /> 6.2. The tolerance mentioned in Note 6.1 may be applied only to mixed products<br /> which have been made from two or more basic textile materials.<br /> The following are the basic textile materials:<br /> - silk;<br /> \u2013 wool;<br /> \u2013 coarse animal hair;<br /> \u2013 fine animal hair;<br /> \u2013 horsehair;<br /> \u2013 cotton;<br /> \u2013 paper-making materials and paper;<br /> \u2013 flax;<br /> \u2013 true hemp;<br /> \u2013 jute and other textile bast fibres;<br /> \u2013 sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave;<br /> \u2013 coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres;<br /> \u2013 synthetic man-made filaments;<br /> \u2013 artificial man-made filaments;<br /> \u2013 current-conducting filaments;<br /> \u2013 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene;<br /> \u2013 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester;<br /> \u2013 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide;<br /> \u2013 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile;<br /> \u2013 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide;<br /> \u2013 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene;<br /> \u2013 synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(phenylene sulphide);<br /> \u2013 synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(vinyl chloride);<br /> - other synthetic man-made staple fibres;<br /> \u2013 artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose;<br /> \u2013 other artificial man-made staple fibres;<br /> \u2013 yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of<br /> polyether, whether or not gimped;<br /> - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester,<br /> whether or not gimped;<br /> - products of heading 5605 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip consisting<br /> of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not<br /> coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm,<br /> sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two<br /> layers of plastic film;<br /> - other products of heading 5605;<br /> \u2013 glass fibres;<br /> \u2013 metal fibres.<br /> Example:<br /> A yarn, of heading 5205, made from cotton fibres of heading 5203 and synthetic<br /> staple fibres of heading 5506, is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating<br /> synthetic staple fibres which do not satisfy the origin rules may be used,<br /> provided that their total weight does not exceed 10% of the weight of the yarn.<br /> Example:<br /> A woollen fabric, of heading 5112, made from woollen yarn of heading 5107<br /> and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading 5509, is a mixed fabric. Therefore,<br /> synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules, or woollen yarn which<br /> does not satisfy the origin rules, or a combination of the two, may be used,<br /> provided that their total weight does not exceed 10% of the weight of the fabric.<br /> Example:<br /> Tufted textile fabric, of heading 5802, made from cotton yarn of heading 5205<br /> and cotton fabric of heading 5210, is only a mixed product if the cotton fabric is<br /> itself a mixed fabric made from yarns classified in two separate headings, or if<br /> the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.<br /> Example:<br /> If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading<br /> 5205 and synthetic fabric of heading 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are<br /> two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is, accordingly, a<br /> mixed product.<br /> 6.3. In the case of products incorporating \"yarn made of polyurethane segmented<br /> with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped\", this tolerance is<br /> 20 % in respect of this yarn.<br /> 6.4. In the case of products incorporating \"strip consisting of a core of aluminium<br /> foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of<br /> a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured<br /> adhesive between two layers of plastic film\", this tolerance is 30 % in respect of<br /> this strip.<br /> Note 7 - Other tolerances applicable to certain textile products<br /> 7.1. Where, in the list, reference is made to this Note, textile materials (with the<br /> exception of linings and interlinings), which do not satisfy the rule set out in the<br /> list in column 3 for the made-up product concerned, may be used, provided that<br /> they are classified in a heading other than that of the product and that their value<br /> does not exceed 8 % of the ex-works price of the product.<br /> 7.2. Without prejudice to Note 6.3, materials, which are not classified within<br /> Chapters 50 to 63, may be used freely in the manufacture of textile products,<br /> whether or not they contain textiles.<br /> Example:<br /> If a rule in the list provides that, for a particular textile item (such as trousers),<br /> yarn must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons,<br /> because buttons are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63. For the same<br /> reason, it does not prevent the use of slide-fasteners, even though slide-fasteners<br /> normally contain textiles.<br /> 7.3. Where a percentage rule applies, the value of non-originating materials which<br /> are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63 must be taken into account when<br /> calculating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.<br /> Note 8 - Definition of specific processes and simple operations carried out in respect<br /> of certain products of Chapter 27<br /> 8.1. For the purposes of headings ex 2707 and 2713, the \"specific processes\" are the<br /> following:<br /> (a) vacuum-distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;<br /> (c) cracking;<br /> (d) reforming;<br /> (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f) the process comprising all of the following operations: processing with<br /> concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation<br /> with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification with naturally active<br /> earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;<br /> (g) polymerisation;<br /> (h) alkylation;<br /> (i) isomerisation.<br /> 8.2. For the purposes of headings 2710, 2711 and 2712, the \"specific processes\" are<br /> the following:<br /> (a) vacuum-distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;<br /> (c) cracking;<br /> (d) reforming;<br /> (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f) the process comprising all of the following operations: processing with<br /> concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation<br /> with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification with naturally active<br /> earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;<br /> (g) polymerisation;<br /> (h) alkylation;<br /> (i) isomerisation;<br /> (k) in respect of heavy oils of heading ex 2710 only, desulphurisation with<br /> hydrogen, resulting in a reduction of at least 85 % of the sulphur content<br /> of the products processed (ASTM D 1266-59 T method);<br /> (l) in respect of products of heading 2710 only, deparaffining by a process<br /> other than filtering;<br /> (m) in respect of heavy oils of heading ex 2710 only, treatment with hydrogen,<br /> at a pressure of more than 20 bar and a temperature of more than 250 \u00b0C,<br /> with the use of a catalyst, other than to effect desulphurisation, when the<br /> hydrogen constitutes an active element in a chemical reaction. The further<br /> treatment, with hydrogen, of lubricating oils of heading ex 2710 (e.g.<br /> hydrofinishing or decolourisation), in order, more especially, to improve<br /> colour or stability shall not, however, be deemed to be a specific process;<br /> (n) in respect of fuel oils of heading ex 2710 only, atmospheric distillation, on<br /> condition that less than 30 % of these products distils, by volume,<br /> including losses, at 300 \u00b0C, by the ASTM D 86 method;<br /> (o) in respect of heavy oils other than gas oils and fuel oils of<br /> heading ex 2710 only, treatment by means of a high-frequency electrical<br /> brush discharge;<br /> (p) in respect of crude products (other than petroleum jelly, ozokerite, lignite<br /> wax or peat wax, paraffin wax containing by weight less than 0.75 % of<br /> oil) of heading ex 2712 only, de-oiling by fractional crystallisation.<br /> 8.3. For the purposes of headings ex 2707 and 2713, simple operations, such as<br /> cleaning, decanting, desalting, water separation, filtering, colouring, marking,<br /> obtaining a sulphur content as a result of mixing products with different sulphur<br /> contents, or any combination of these operations or like operations, do not", "ShowProductAffected": false, "ProductAffected": null, "RevisionName": null, "Rank": 0, "ShowRooExceptions": false, "RooExceptions": null}], "SpecificNote": [{"RooCode": null, "RooText": null, "ShowProductAffected": false, "ProductAffected": null, "RevisionName": null, "Rank": 0, "ShowRooExceptions": false, "RooExceptions": null}], "Documents": [{"DocDesc": "Certificate of origin", "DocFileName": "itc00740_coo.pdf", "DocType": "1_coo", "WebLink": null}, {"DocDesc": "Product-specific rules of origin", "DocFileName": "itc00740_sroo.pdf", "DocType": "2_sroo", "WebLink": null}, {"DocDesc": "Chapter on rules of origin", "DocFileName": "itc00740_roo.pdf", "DocType": "3_roo", "WebLink": "https://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar:04c776da-4322-11e8-a9f4-01aa75ed71a1.0003.02/DOC_11&format=PDF#page=2"}, {"DocDesc": "Customs administration", "DocFileName": "itc00740_cusa.pdf", "DocType": "5_cusa", "WebLink": "http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-7972-2018-REV-1/en/pdf#page=65"}, {"DocDesc": "Full text of agreement", "DocFileName": "itc00740_full.pdf", "DocType": "8_full", "WebLink": "https://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/press/index.cfm?id=961"}]}, "FtaProvisions": {"RooProvision": [{"ProvisionAbbrev": "accum", "ProvisionCode": "Cumulation", "ProvisionValue": "diagonal cumulation", "ProvisionRank": null, "ProvisionGlossary": "A provision which allows to consider goods obtained in as well as processing taking place in one FTA member country as originating in another.", "ProvisionGlossaryLink": "/en/glossary?uid=accum&returnto=gloscenter", "ProvisionLegalExtract": "Article 3 : Cumulation of Origin <br /> 1 Notwithstanding Article 2 (General Requirements), products shall be considered as <br /> originating in a Party if such products are obtained there by incorporating materials <br /> originating in the other Party, provided that the working or processing carried out <br /> goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 6 (Insufficient Working or <br /> Processing).

The said authorities may require a translation <br /> of an origin declaration. <br /> Article 22 : Exemptions from Origin Declaration <br /> 1 Products sent as small packages from private persons to private persons or forming <br /> part of travellers' personal luggage shall be admitted as originating products <br /> without requiring the submission of an origin declaration, provided that such <br /> products are not imported by way of trade and have been declared as meeting the <br /> requirements of this Protocol and where there is no doubt as to the veracity of such <br /> a declaration. In the case of products sent by post, this declaration can be made on <br /> the customs declaration CN22/CN23 or on a sheet of paper annexed to that document. <br /> 2 Imports which are occasional and consist solely of products for the personal use of <br /> the recipients or travellers or their families shall not be considered as imports by <br /> way of trade if it is evident from the nature and quantity of the products that no <br /> commercial purpose is intended. <br /> 3 The total value of these products shall not exceed 500 euro in the case of small <br /> packages or 1200 euro in the case of products forming part of travellers' personal luggage. <br /> Article 24 : Preservation of Origin Declaration and Supporting Documents <br /> 1 The exporter making out an origin declaration shall keep for at least three years a <br /> copy of this origin declaration as well as the documents referred to in paragraph 3 <br /> of Article 17 (Conditions for Making Out an Origin Declaration). <br /> 2 The customs authorities of the importing Party shall keep for at least three years the <br /> origin declarations submitted to them. <br /> 3 Each Party shall permit, in accordance with that Party's laws and regulations, <br /> exporters in its territory to maintain documentation or records in any medium, <br /> provided that the documentation or records can be retrieved and printed. <br /> Article 26 : Amounts Expressed in Euro <br /> 1 For the application of the provisions of subparagraph 1(a)(ii) of Article 17 <br /> (Conditions for Making Out an Origin Declaration) and paragraph 3 of Article 22 <br /> (Exemptions from Origin Declaration) in cases where products are invoiced in a <br /> currency other than euro, amounts in the national currencies of the Member States <br /> of the Union equivalent to the amounts expressed in euro shall be fixed annually by <br /> each of the countries concerned. <br /> 2 A consignment shall benefit from the provisions of subparagraph 1(a)(ii) of Article <br /> 17 (Conditions for Making Out an Origin Declaration) and paragraph 3 of Article <br /> 22 (Exemptions from Origin Declaration) by reference to the currency in which the <br /> invoice is drawn up, according to the amount fixed by the Party concerned. <br /> 3 The amounts to be used in any given national currency shall be the equivalent in <br /> that currency of the amounts expressed in euro as at the first working day of <br /> October. The amounts shall be communicated to the European Commission by 15 <br /> October and shall apply from 1 January the following year. The European <br /> Commission shall notify all countries concerned of the relevant amounts. <br /> 4 A Member State of the Union may round up or down the amount resulting from the <br /> conversion into its national currency of an amount expressed in euro. The rounded- <br /> off amount may not differ from the amount resulting from the conversion by more <br /> than five percent. A Member State of the Union may retain unchanged its national <br /> currency equivalent of an amount expressed in euro if, at the time of the annual <br /> adjustment provided for in paragraph 3, the conversion of that amount, prior to any <br /> rounding-off, results in an increase of less than fifteen percent in the national <br /> currency equivalent. The national currency equivalent may be retained unchanged <br /> if the conversion would result in a decrease in that equivalent value. <br /> 5 The amounts expressed in euro shall be reviewed by the Parties in the Committee <br /> on Customs established pursuant to Article 16.2 (Specialised Committees) at the <br /> request of the Union or of Singapore. When carrying out this review, the Parties <br /> shall consider the desirability of preserving the effects of the limits concerned in <br /> real terms.

For this purpose, they shall have the right to call for any evidence and to <br /> carry out any inspection of the exporter's accounts or any other check considered appropriate. <br /> 4 If the customs authorities of the importing Party decide to suspend the granting of <br /> preferential treatment to the products concerned while awaiting the results of the <br /> verification, release of the products shall be offered to the importer subject to any <br /> precautionary measures judged necessary. Any suspension of preferential treatment <br /> shall be reinstated as soon as possible after the originating status of the products <br /> concerned or the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol has been <br /> ascertained by the customs authorities of the importing Party. <br /> 5 The customs authorities requesting the verification shall be informed of the results <br /> of this verification as soon as possible.

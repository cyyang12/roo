The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column gives the subheading number,<br /> heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonized System and the second column gives the description of<br /> goods used in that system for that subheading, heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns, a rule is<br /> specified in column 3 or 4. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an \"ex\", this signifies<br /> that the rules in column 3 or 4 apply only to the part of that subheading, heading or chapter as described in<br /> column 2.<br /> 2.2.  Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number is given and the description<br /> of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rules in column 3 or 4 apply to all<br /> products which, under the Harmonized System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in any of the headings<br /> grouped together in column 1.<br /> 2.3.  Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each indent contains the<br /> description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rules in column 3 or 4.<br /> 2.4.  Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns 3 and 4, the exporter may opt, as<br /> an alternative, to apply either the rule set out in column 3 or that set out in column 4. If no origin rule is given in<br /> column 4, the rule set out in column 3 is to be applied.<br /> N o t e  3 :<br /> 3.1. The provisions of Article 5 of Annex II, concerning products having acquired originating status which are used in<br /> the manufacture of other products, shall apply, regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory<br /> where these products are used or in another factory in the EU Party or in the Republics of the CA Party.<br /> Example:<br /> An engine of heading 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-originating materials which may be<br /> incorporated may not exceed 40 percent of the ex-works price, is made from \"other alloy steel roughly shaped by<br /> forging\" of heading ex 7224.<br /> If this forging has been forged in the EU Party from a non-originating ingot, it has already acquired originating<br /> status by virtue of the rule for heading ex 7224 in the list. The forging can then count as originating in the value-<br /> calculation for the engine, regardless of whether it was produced in the same factory or in another factory in the EU<br /> Party. The value of the non-originating ingot is thus not taken into account when adding up the value of the non-<br /> originating materials used.<br /> 3.2. The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing required, and the carrying-out of<br /> more  working  or  processing  also  confers  originating  status;  conversely,  the  carrying-out  of  less  working  or<br /> processing cannot confer originating status. Thus, if a rule provides that non-originating material, at a certain<br /> level of manufacture, may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed, and<br /> the use of such material at a later stage is not.<br /> 3.3. Without prejudice to Note 3.2, where a rule uses the expression \"Manufacture from materials of any heading\", then<br /> materials of any heading(s) (even materials of the same description and heading as the product) may be used,<br /> subject, however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in the rule.<br /> However, the expression \"Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of heading\u2026\" or<br /> \"Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of the same heading as the product\" means<br /> that materials of any heading(s) may be used, except those of the same description as the product as given in<br /> column 2 of the list.<br /> 3.4. When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one material, this means that<br /> one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all be used.<br /> 1816 EN<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for fabrics of headings 5208 to 5212 provides that natural fibres may be used and that chemical materials,<br /> among other materials, may also be used. This does not mean that both have to be used; it is possible to use one or<br /> the other, or both.<br /> 3.5.  Where a rule in the list specifies that a product shall be manufactured from a particular material, the condition<br /> obviously does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the<br /> rule. (See also Note 6.2 below in relation to textiles).<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for prepared foods of heading 1902, which specifically excludes the use of cereals and their derivatives,<br /> does not prevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and other additives which are not products from cereals.<br /> However, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be manufactured from the particular<br /> materials specified in the list, can be produced from a material of the same nature at an earlier stage of manufacture.<br /> Example:<br /> In the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 made from non-woven materials, if the use of only non-<br /> originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is not possible to start from non-woven cloth - even if non-<br /> woven cloths cannot normally be made from yarn. In such cases, the starting material would normally be at the<br /> stage before yarn - that is, the fibre stage.<br /> 3.6.  Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of non-originating materials that can<br /> be used, then these percentages may not be added together. In other words, the maximum value of all the non-<br /> originating materials used may never exceed the higher of the percentages given. Furthermore, the individual<br /> percentages shall not be exceeded, in relation to the particular materials to which they apply.<br /> N o t e  4 :<br /> 4.1.  The term \"natural fibres\" is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic fibres. It is restricted to<br /> the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres which have<br /> been carded, combed or otherwise processed, but not spun.<br /> 4.2.  The term \"natural fibres\" includes horsehair of heading 0511, silk of headings 5002 and 5003, as well as wool-<br /> fibres and fine or coarse animal hair of headings 5101 to 5105, cotton fibres of headings 5201 to 5203, and other<br /> vegetable fibres of headings 5301 to 5305.<br /> 4.3.  The terms \"textile pulp\", \"chemical materials\" and \"paper-making materials\" are used in the list to describe the<br /> materials, not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres<br /> or yarns.<br /> 4.4.  The term \"man-made staple fibres\" is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament tow, staple fibres or<br /> waste, of headings 5501 to 5507.<br /> N o t e  5 :<br /> 5.1.  Where, for a given product in the list, reference is made to this Note, the conditions set out in column 3 shall not<br /> be applied to any basic textile materials used in the manufacture of this product and which, taken together,<br /> represent 10 percent or less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 5.3 and<br /> 5.4 below.)<br /> 5.2.  However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 5.1 may be applied only to mixed products which have been made from<br /> two or more basic textile materials.<br /> The following are the basic textile materials:<br /> \u2014 silk,<br /> \u2014 wool,<br /> \u2014 coarse animal hair,<br /> \u2014 fine animal hair,<br /> \u2014 horsehair,<br /> \u2014 cotton,<br /> \u2014 paper-making materials and paper,<br /> \u2014 flax,<br /> \u2014 true hemp,<br /> \u2014 jute and other textile bast fibres,<br /> 15.12.2012 EN<br /> \u2014 sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave,<br /> \u2014 coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made filaments,<br /> \u2014 artificial man-made filaments,<br /> \u2014 current-conducting filaments,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(phenylene sulphide),<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(vinyl chloride),<br /> \u2014 other synthetic man-made staple fibres,<br /> \u2014 artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose,<br /> \u2014 other artificial man-made staple fibres,<br /> \u2014 yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped,<br /> \u2014 yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester, whether or not gimped,<br /> \u2014 products of heading 5605 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a<br /> core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched<br /> by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film,<br /> \u2014 other products of heading 5605.<br /> Example:<br /> A yarn, of heading 5205, made from cotton fibres of heading 5203 and synthetic staple fibres of heading 5506, is a<br /> mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres which do not satisfy the origin-rules (which require<br /> manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed<br /> 10 percent of the weight of the yarn.<br /> Example:<br /> A woollen fabric, of heading 5112, made from woollen yarn of heading 5107 and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of<br /> heading 5509, is a mixed fabric. Therefore, synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the origin-rules (which require<br /> manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp), or woollen yarn which does not satisfy the origin-rules (which<br /> require  manufacture  from  natural  fibres,  not  carded  or  combed  or  otherwise  prepared  for  spinning),  or  a<br /> combination  of  the  two,  may be  used, provided that their total  weight does  not  exceed<br /> weight of the fabric.<br /> Example:<br /> Tufted textile fabric, of heading 5802, made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and cotton fabric of heading 5210,<br /> is only a mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric made from yarns classified in two separate<br /> headings, or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.<br /> Example:<br /> If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and synthetic fabric of<br /> heading 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is,<br /> accordingly, a mixed product.<br /> 5.3. In the case of products incorporating \"yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether,<br /> whether or not gimped\", this tolerance is 20 percent in respect of this yarn.<br /> 5.4. In the case of products incorporating \"strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film<br /> whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a<br /> transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film\", this tolerance is 30 percent in respect of<br /> this strip.<br /> 1818 EN<br /> N o t e  6 :<br /> 6.1.  Where, in the list, reference is made to this Note, textile materials (with the exceptions of linings and interlinings),<br /> which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the made-up product concerned, may be used,<br /> provided that they are classified in a heading other than that of the product and that their value does not exceed 8<br /> percent of the ex-works price of the product.<br /> 6.2.  Without prejudice to Note 6.3, materials, which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63, may be used freely in<br /> the manufacture of textile products, whether or not they contain textiles.<br /> Example:<br /> If a rule in the list provides that, for a particular textile item (such as trousers), yarn shall be used, this does not<br /> prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because buttons are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63. For the<br /> same reason, it does not prevent the use of slide-fasteners, even though slide-fasteners normally contain textiles.<br /> 6.3.  Where a percentage-rule applies, the value of materials which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63 shall be<br /> taken into account when calculating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.<br /> N o t e  7 :<br /> 7.1. For the purposes of headings ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex 3403, the \"specific processes\" are<br /> the following:<br /> (a)  vacuum-distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation-process;<br /> (c)  cracking;<br /> (d) reforming;<br /> (e)  extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f)  the process comprising all of the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or<br /> sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification with naturally-active<br /> earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;<br /> (g) polymerisation;<br /> (h) alkylation;<br /> (i)  isomerisation.<br /> 7.2. For the purposes of headings 2710, 2711 and 2712, the \"specific processes\" are the following:<br /> (a)   vacuum-distillation;<br /> (b)   redistillation by a very thorough fractionation-process;<br /> (c)   cracking;<br /> (d)   reforming;<br /> (e)   extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f) the process comprising all of the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or<br /> sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification with naturally-active<br /> earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;<br /> (g)   polymerisation;<br /> (h)   alkylation;<br /> (i) isomerisation;<br /> (j) in respect of heavy oils of heading ex 2710 only, desulphurisation with hydrogen, resulting in a reduction of at<br /> least 85 percent of the sulphur-content of the products processed (ASTM D 1266-59 T method);<br /> (k)   in respect of products of heading 2710 only, deparaffining by a process other than filtering;<br /> (l) in respect of heavy oils of heading ex 2710 only, treatment with hydrogen, at a pressure of more than 20 bar<br /> and a temperature of more than 250 \u00b0C, with the use of a catalyst, other than to effect desulphurisation, when<br /> the hydrogen constitutes an active element in a chemical reaction. The further treatment, with hydrogen, of<br /> lubricating oils  of  heading ex 2710 (e.g. hydrofinishing or  decolourisation), in  order, more  especially, to<br /> improve colour or stability shall not, however, be deemed to be a specific process;<br /> 15.12.2012 EN<br /> (m) in respect of fuel oils of heading ex 2710 only, atmospheric distillation, on condition that less than 30 percent<br /> of these products distils, by volume, including losses, at 300 \u00b0C, by the ASTM D 86 method;<br /> (n)   in respect of heavy oils other than gas oils and fuel oils of heading ex 2710 only, treatment by means of a<br /> high-frequency electrical brush-discharge;<br /> (o)   in respect of crude products (other than petroleum jelly, ozokerite, lignite wax or peat wax, paraffin wax<br /> containing by weight less than 0.75 percent of oil) of heading ex 2712 only, de-oiling by fractional cryst\u00ad<br /> allisation.<br /> 7.3.  For the purposes of headings ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex 3403, simple operations, such as<br /> cleaning, decanting, desalting, water-separation, filtering, colouring, marking, obtaining a sulphur-content as a result<br /> of mixing products with different sulphur-contents, or any combination of these operations or like operations, do<br /> not confer origin.<br /> N o t e  8 :<br /> For the purpose of Article 4 of Annex II agricultural and horticultural goods grown in the territory of a Party shall be<br /> treated as originating in the territory of that Party even if grown from seeds, bulbs, rootstock, cuttings, grafts, shoots,<br /> buds, or other live parts of plants imported from a non-Party.<br /> N o t e  9 :<br /> For the purpose of Article 6 of Annex II \"simple\" describes activities which need neither special skills nor machines,<br /> apparatus or equipment specially produced or installed for carrying out the activity. However, simple mixing does not<br /> include chemical reaction.

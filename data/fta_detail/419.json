The first column gives<br /> the heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonized System and the second<br /> column gives the description of goods used in that system for that heading or chapter.<br /> For each entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in column 3 or 4.  Where, in<br /> some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an 'ex', this signifies that the<br /> rules in column 3 or 4 apply only to the part of that heading as described in column 2.<br /> 2.2 Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number<br /> is given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms,<br /> the adjacent rules in column 3 or 4 apply to all products which, under the Harmonized<br /> System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in any of the headings grouped<br /> together in column 1.<br /> 2.3 Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a<br /> heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the<br /> adjacent rules in column 3 or 4.<br /> 2.4 Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns 3 and<br /> 4, the exporter may opt, as an alternative, to apply either the rule set out in column 3 or<br /> that set out in column 4.  If no origin rule is given in column 4, the rule set out in<br /> column 3 has to be applied.<br /> Note 3:<br /> 3.1 The provisions of Article 6 of the Protocol, concerning products having acquired<br /> originating status which are used in the manufacture of other products, shall apply,<br /> regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where these<br /> products are used or in another factory in Turkey or in Georgia.<br /> Example:<br /> An engine of heading 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-<br /> originating materials which may be incorporated may not exceed 40 per cent of the ex-<br /> works price, is made from \"other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging\" of heading ex<br /> 7224<br /> If this forging has been forged in Turkey from a non-originating ingot, it has already<br /> acquired originating status by virtue of the rule for heading ex 7224 in the list.  The<br /> forging can then count as originating in the value-calculation for the engine, regardless<br /> of whether it was produced in the same factory or in another factory in Turkey<br /> concerned. The value of the non-originating ingot is thus not taken into account when<br /> adding up the value of the non-originating materials used.<br /> 3.2 The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing required,<br /> and the carrying-out of more working or processing also confers originating status;<br /> conversely, the carrying-out of less working or processing cannot confer originating<br /> status. Thus, if a rule provides that non-originating material, at a certain level of<br /> manufacture, may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is<br /> allowed, and the use of such material at a later stage is not.<br /> 3.3 Without prejudice to Note 3.2, where a rule uses the expression \"Manufacture from<br /> materials of any heading\", then materials of any heading(s) (even materials of the same<br /> description and heading as the product) may be used, subject, however, to any specific<br /> limitations which may also be contained in the rule.<br /> However, the expression \"Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other<br /> materials of heading ...\" or \"Manufacture from materials of any heading, including<br /> other materials of the same heading as the product\" means that materials of any<br /> heading(s) may be used, except those of the same description as the product as given in<br /> column 2 of the list.<br /> 3.4 When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than<br /> one material, this means that one or more materials may be used. It does not require<br /> that all be used.<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for fabrics of headings 5208 to 5212 provides that natural fibres may be used<br /> and that chemical materials, among other materials, may also be used.  This does not<br /> mean that both have to be used; it is possible to use one or the other, or both.<br /> 3.5 Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular<br /> material, the condition obviously does not prevent the use of other materials which,<br /> because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule. (See also Note 6.2 below in<br /> relation to textiles).<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for prepared foods of heading 1904, which specifically excludes the use of<br /> cereals and their derivatives, does not prevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and<br /> other additives which are not products from cereals.<br /> However, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be manufactured<br /> from the particular materials specified in the list, can be produced from a material of<br /> the same nature at an earlier stage of manufacture.<br /> Example:<br /> In the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 made from non-woven materials, if<br /> the use of only non-originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is not possible<br /> to start from non-woven cloth - even if non-woven cloths cannot normally be made<br /> from yarn.  In such cases, the starting material would normally be at the stage before<br /> yarn - that is, the fibre stage.<br /> 3.6 Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of non-<br /> originating materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be added<br /> together. In other words, the maximum value of all the non-originating materials used<br /> may never exceed the higher of the percentages given. Furthermore, the individual<br /> percentages must not be exceeded, in relation to the particular materials to which they<br /> apply.<br /> Note 4:<br /> 4.1 The term \"natural fibres\" is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or<br /> synthetic fibres.  It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including<br /> waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres that have been carded, combed<br /> or otherwise processed but not spun.<br /> 4.2 The term \"natural fibres\" includes horsehair of heading 0503, silk of headings 5002 and<br /> 5003 as well as the wool-fibres and fine or coarse animal hair of headings 5101 to<br /> 5105, the cotton fibres of headings 5201 to 5203, and the other vegetable fibres of<br /> headings 5301 to 5305.<br /> 4.3 The terms \"textile pulp\", \"chemical materials\" and \"paper-making materials\" are used<br /> in the list to describe the materials, not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be<br /> used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.<br /> 4.4 The term \"man-made staple fibres\" is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial<br /> filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of headings 5501 to 5507.<br /> Note 5:<br /> 5.1 Where, for a given product in the list, a reference is made to this Note, the conditions<br /> set out in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials used in the<br /> manufacture of this product and which, taken together, represent 10 per cent or less of<br /> the total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 5.3 and 5.4<br /> below).<br /> 5.2 However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 5.1 may be applied only to mixed products<br /> which have been made from two or more basic textile materials.<br /> The following are the basic textile materials:<br /> - silk,<br /> - wool,<br /> - coarse animal hair,<br /> - fine animal hair,<br /> - horsehair,<br /> - cotton,<br /> - paper-making materials and paper,<br /> - flax,<br /> - true hemp,<br /> - jute and other textile bast fibres,<br /> - sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave,<br /> - coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,<br /> - synthetic man-made filaments,<br /> - artificial man-made filaments,<br /> - current-conducting filaments,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(phenylene sulphide),<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(vinyl chloride),<br /> - other synthetic man-made staple fibres,<br /> - artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose,<br /> - other artificial man-made staple fibres,<br /> - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or<br /> not gimped,<br /> - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester, whether or<br /> not gimped,<br /> - products of heading 5605 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core of<br /> aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium<br /> powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or<br /> coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film,<br /> - other products of heading 5605.<br /> Example:<br /> A yarn, of heading 5205, made from cotton fibres of heading 5203 and synthetic staple<br /> fibres of heading 5506, is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple<br /> fibres which do not satisfy the origin-rules (which require manufacture from chemical<br /> materials or textile pulp) may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed<br /> 10 per cent of the weight of the yarn.<br /> Example:<br /> A woollen fabric, of heading 5112, made from woollen yarn of heading 5107 and<br /> synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading 5509, is a mixed fabric.  Therefore, synthetic<br /> yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from chemical<br /> materials or textile pulp), or woollen yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules (which<br /> require manufacture from natural fibres, not carded or combed or otherwise prepared<br /> for spinning), or a combination of the two, may be used, provided their total weight<br /> does not exceed 10 per cent of the weight of the fabric.<br /> Example:<br /> Tufted textile fabric, of heading 5802, made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and<br /> cotton fabric of heading 5210, is only mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a<br /> mixed fabric made from yarns classified in two separate headings, or if the cotton yarns<br /> used are themselves mixtures.<br /> Example:<br /> If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading 5205<br /> and synthetic fabric of heading 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate<br /> basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is, accordingly, a mixed product.<br /> 5.3 In the case of products incorporating \"yarn made of polyurethane segmented with<br /> flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped\", this tolerance is 20 per cent in<br /> respect of this yarn.<br /> 5.4 In the case of products incorporating \"strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of<br /> a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not<br /> exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between<br /> two layers of plastic film\", this tolerance is 30 per cent in respect of this strip.<br /> Note 6:<br /> 6.1 Where, in the list, reference is made to this Note, textile materials (with the exception<br /> of linings and interlinings), which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3<br /> for the made-up product concerned, may be used, provided that they are classified in a<br /> heading other than that of the product and that their value does not exceed 8 per cent of<br /> the ex-works price of the product.<br /> 6.2 Without prejudice to Note 6.3, materials, which are not classified within Chapters 50 to<br /> 63, may be used freely in the manufacture of textile products, whether or not they<br /> contain textiles.<br /> Example:<br /> If a rule in the list provides that, for a particular textile item (such as trousers), yarn<br /> must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because<br /> buttons are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63.  For the same reason, it does not<br /> prevent the use of slide-fasteners, even though slide-fasteners normally contain textiles.<br /> 6.3 Where a percentage-rule applies, the value of materials which are not classified within<br /> Chapters 50 to 63 must be taken into account when calculating the value of the non-<br /> originating materials incorporated.<br /> Note 7<br /> 7.1 For the purposes of headings ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex 3403, the<br /> \"specific processes\" are the following:<br /> (a) vacuum distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;<br /> (c) cracking;<br /> (d) reforming;<br /> (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f) the  process  comprising  all  of  the  following  operations:  processing  with<br /> concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with<br /> alkaline agents; decolorisation and purification with naturally active earth,<br /> activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;<br /> (g) polymerisation;<br /> (h) alkylation;<br /> (i) isomerisation.<br /> 7.2 For the purposes of headings 2710, 2711 and 2712, the \"specific processes\" are the<br /> following:<br /> (a) vacuum distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;<br /> (c) cracking;<br /> (d) reforming;<br /> (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f) the   process   comprising   all   the   following   operations:   processing   with<br /> concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with<br /> alkaline agents; decolorisation and purification with naturally-active earth,<br /> activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;<br /> (g) polymerisation;<br /> (h) alkylation;<br /> (ij) isomerisation;<br /> (k) in respect of heavy oils of heading ex 2710 only, desulphurisation with<br /> hydrogen, resulting in a reduction of at least 85 per cent of the sulphur-content<br /> of the products processed (ASTM D 1266-59 T method);<br /> (l) in respect of products of heading 2710 only, deparaffining by a process other<br /> than filtering;<br /> (m) in respect of heavy oils of heading ex 2710 only, treatment with hydrogen, at a<br /> pressure of more than 20 bar and a temperature of more than 250\u00b0C, with the<br /> use of a catalyst, other than to effect desulphurisation, when the hydrogen<br /> constitutes an active element in a chemical reaction.  The further treatment,<br /> with hydrogen, of lubricating oils of heading ex 2710 (e.g. hydrofinishing or<br /> decolourisation), in order, more especially, to improve colour or stability shall<br /> not, however, be deemed to be a specific process;<br /> (n) in respect of fuel oils of heading ex 2710 only, atmospheric distillation, on<br /> condition that less than 30 per cent of these products distils, by volume,<br /> including losses, at 300\u00b0C by the ASTM D 86 method;<br /> (o) in respect of heavy oils other than gas oils and fuel oils of heading ex 2710<br /> only, treatment by means of a high-frequency electrical brush-discharge;<br /> 7.3 For the purposes of headings ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex 3403,<br /> simple operations, such as cleaning, decanting, desalting, water-separation, filtering,<br /> colouring, marking, obtaining a sulphur-content as a result of mixing products with<br /> different sulphur contents, any combination of these operations or like operations, do<br /> not confer origin.", "ShowProductAffected": false, "ProductAffected": null, "RevisionName": null, "Rank": 0, "ShowRooExceptions": false, "RooExceptions": null}], "SpecificNote": [{"RooCode": null, "RooText": null, "ShowProductAffected": false, "ProductAffected": null, "RevisionName": null, "Rank": 0, "ShowRooExceptions": false, "RooExceptions": null}], "Documents": [{"DocDesc": "Certificate of origin", "DocFileName": "itc00424_coo.pdf", "DocType": "1_coo", "WebLink": null}, {"DocDesc": "Product-specific rules of origin", "DocFileName": "itc00424_sroo.pdf", "DocType": "2_sroo", "WebLink": null}, {"DocDesc": "Chapter on rules of origin", "DocFileName": "itc00424_roo.pdf", "DocType": "3_roo", "WebLink": null}, {"DocDesc": "Full text of agreement", "DocFileName": "itc00424_full.pdf", "DocType": "8_full", "WebLink": "https://trade.gov.tr/data/5b9111f813b8770becf1e74b/3084ba862ac8810125184a17da1112da.pdf"}]}, "FtaProvisions": {"RooProvision": [{"ProvisionAbbrev": "accum", "ProvisionCode": "Cumulation", "ProvisionValue": "bilateral", "ProvisionRank": null, "ProvisionGlossary": "A provision which allows to consider goods obtained in as well as processing taking place in one FTA member country as originating in another.", "ProvisionGlossaryLink": "/en/glossary?uid=accum&returnto=gloscenter", "ProvisionLegalExtract": "Article 3 : Bilateral Cumulation in Turkey <br /> Materials originating in Georgia shall be considered as materials originating in Turkey <br /> when incorporated into a product obtained there.

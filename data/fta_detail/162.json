The first column gives the heading number or<br /> chapter number used in the Harmonized System and the second column gives the description of goods used in<br /> that system for that heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns a rule is specified in columns 3<br /> or 4. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an ‘ex', this signifies that the rules in<br /> columns 3 or 4 apply only to the part of that heading as described in column 2.<br /> 2 Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number is given and the<br /> description of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rules in columns 3 or 4<br /> apply to all products which, under the Harmonized System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in any<br /> of the headings grouped together in column 1.<br /> 3 Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each indent contains<br /> the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rules in columns 3 or 4.<br /> 4 Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns 3 and 4, the exporter may opt,<br /> as an alternative, to apply either the rule set out in column 3 or that set out in column 4. If no origin rule is<br /> given in column 4, the rule set out in column 3 has to be applied.<br /> Note 3:<br /> 1 The provisions of Article 4 of the Protocol concerning products having acquired originating status which are<br /> used in the manufacture of other products apply regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the<br /> factory where these products are used or in another factory in the Community or in the ACP States.<br /> Example:<br /> An engine of heading No 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-originating materials which<br /> may be incorporated may not exceed 40 per cent of the ex-works price, is made from ‘other alloy steel roughly<br /> shaped by forging' of heading No ex 7224.<br /> If this forging has been forged in the Community from a non-originating ingot, it has already acquired<br /> originating status by virtue of the rule for heading No ex 7224 in the list. The forging can then count as<br /> originating in the value calculation for the engine regardless of whether it was produced in the same factory or<br /> in another factory in the Community. The value of the non-originating ingot is thus not taken into account<br /> when adding up the value of the non-originating materials used.<br /> 2 The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing required and the carrying out of<br /> more working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the carrying out of less working or<br /> processing cannot confer originating status. Thus if a rule provides that non-originating material at a certain<br /> level of manufacture may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed and the<br /> use of such material at a later stage is not.<br /> L 317/110 EN<br /> 3 Without prejudice to Note 3.2 where a rule states that ‘materials of any heading' may be used, materials of the<br /> same heading as the product may also be used, subject, however, to any specific limitations which may also be<br /> contained in the rule. However, the expression ‘manufacture from materials of any heading, including other<br /> materials of heading No ...' means that only materials classified in the same heading as the product of a different<br /> description than that of the product as given in column 2 of the list may be used.<br /> 4 When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one material, this means<br /> that any one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all be used.<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for fabrics of heading Nos 5208 to 5212 provides that natural fibres may be used and that chemical<br /> materials, among other materials, may also be used. This does not mean that both have to be used; it is possible<br /> to use one or the other or both.<br /> 5 Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular material, the condition<br /> obviously does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy<br /> the rule. (See also Note 6.3 below in relation to textiles).<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for prepared foods of heading No 1904 which specifically excludes the use of cereals and their<br /> derivatives does not prevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and other additives which are not products<br /> from cereals.<br /> However, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be manufactured from the particular<br /> materials specified in the list, can be produced from a material of the same nature at an earlier stage of<br /> manufacture.<br /> Example:<br /> In the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 made from non-woven materials, if the use of only non-<br /> originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is not possible to start from non-woven cloth — even if<br /> non-woven cloths cannot normally be made from yarn. In such cases, the starting material would normally be<br /> at the stage before yarn — that is the fibre stage.<br /> 6 Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of non-originating materials that<br /> can be used, then these percentages may not be added together. In other words, the maximum value of all the<br /> non-originating materials used may never exceed the highest of the percentages given. Furthermore, the<br /> individual percentages must not be exceeded in relation to the particular materials they apply to.<br /> Note 4:<br /> 1 The term ‘natural fibres' is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic fibres. It is restricted<br /> to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres that<br /> have been carded, combed or otherwise processed but not spun.<br /> 2 The term ‘natural fibres' includes horsehair of heading No 0503, silk of heading Nos 5002 and 5003 as well as<br /> the wool fibres, fine or coarse animal hair of heading Nos 5101 to 5105, the cotton fibres of heading<br /> Nos 5201 to 5203 and the other vegetable fibres of heading Nos 5301 to 5305.<br /> 3 The terms ‘textile pulp', ‘chemical materials' and ‘paper-making materials' are used in the list to describe the<br /> materials not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper<br /> fibres or yarns.<br /> 15.12.2000 EN<br /> 4 The term ‘man-made staple fibres' is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament tow, staple fibres<br /> or waste, of heading Nos 5501 to 5507.<br /> Note 5:<br /> 1 Where for a given product in the list a reference is made to this note, the conditions set out in column 3 shall<br /> not be applied to any basic textile materials, used in the manufacture of this product, which, taken together,<br /> represent 10 per cent or less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 5.3 and<br /> 5.4 below).<br /> 2 However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 5.1 may only be applied to mixed products which have been made<br /> from two or more basic textile materials.<br /> The following are the basic textile materials:<br /> — silk,<br /> — wool,<br /> — coarse animal hair,<br /> — fine animal hair,<br /> — horsehair,<br /> — cotton,<br /> — paper-making materials and paper,<br /> — flax,<br /> — true hemp,<br /> — jute and other textile bast fibres,<br /> — sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave,<br /> — coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,<br /> — synthetic man-made filaments,<br /> — artificial man-made filaments,<br /> — current conducting filaments,<br /> — synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene,<br /> — synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester,<br /> — synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide,<br /> — synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile,<br /> — synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide,<br /> — synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene,<br /> — synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyphenylene sulphide,<br /> — synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyvinyl chloride,<br /> — other synthetic man-made staple fibres,<br /> — artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose,<br /> L 317/112 EN<br /> — other artificial man-made staple fibres,<br /> — yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether whether or not gimped,<br /> — yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester whether or not gimped,<br /> — products of heading No 5605 (metallized yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil<br /> or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5<br /> mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film,<br /> — other products of heading No 5605.<br /> Example:<br /> A yarn of heading No 5205 made from cotton fibres of heading No 5203 and synthetic staple fibres of heading<br /> No 5506 is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres that do not satisfy the origin rules<br /> (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) may be used up to a weight of 10 per cent<br /> of the yarn.<br /> Example:<br /> A woollen fabric of heading No 5112 made from woollen yarn of heading No 5107 and synthetic yarn of<br /> staple fibres of heading No 5509 is a mixed fabric. Therefore synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the origin<br /> rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) or woollen yarn that does not satisfy<br /> the origin rules (which require manufacture from natural fibres, not carded or combed or otherwise prepared<br /> for spinning) or a combination of the two may be used provided their total weight does not exceed 10 per cent<br /> of the weight of the fabric.<br /> Example:<br /> Tufted textile fabric of heading No 5802 made from cotton yarn of heading No 5205 and cotton fabric of<br /> heading No 5210 is only a mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric being made from yarns<br /> classified in two separate headings or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.<br /> Example:<br /> If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading No 5205 and synthetic fabric<br /> of heading No 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic textile materials and the tufted<br /> textile fabric is accordingly a mixed product.<br /> 3 In the case of products incorporating ‘yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether<br /> whether or not gimped' this tolerance is 20 per cent in respect of this yarn.<br /> 4 In the case of products incorporating ‘strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film<br /> whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of an<br /> adhesive between two layers of plastic film', this tolerance is 30 per cent in respect of this strip.<br /> Note 6:<br /> 1 In the case of those textile products, which are marked in the list by a footnote referring to this Introductory<br /> Note, textile trimmings and accessories which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the<br /> made up products concerned may be used provided that their weight does not exceed 10 % of the total weight<br /> of all the textile materials incorporated.<br /> Textile trimmings and accessories are those classified in Chapters 50 to 63. Linings and interlinings are not be<br /> regarded as trimmings or accessories.<br /> 2 Any non-textile trimmings and accessories or other materials used which contain textiles do not have to satisfy<br /> the conditions set out in column 3 even though they fall outside the scope of Note 3.5.<br /> 15.12.2000 EN<br /> 3 In accordance with Note 3.5, any non-originating non-textile trimmings and accessories or other product,<br /> which do not contain any textiles, may, anyway, be used freely where they cannot be made from the materials<br /> listed in column 3.<br /> — For example (1), if a rule in the list says that for a particular textile item, such as a blouse, yarn must be<br /> used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because they cannot be made from<br /> textile materials.<br /> 4 Where a percentage rule applies, the value of trimmings and accessories must be taken into account when<br /> calculating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.<br /> Note 7:<br /> 1 For the purposes of heading Nos ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex 3403, the ‘specific<br /> processes' are the following:<br /> (a) vacuum distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process (2);<br /> (c) cracking;<br /> (d) reforming;<br /> (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f) the process comprising all the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum<br /> or sulphuric anhydride; neutralization with alkaline agents; decolorization and purification with naturally<br /> active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;<br /> (g) polymerization;<br /> (h) alkylation;<br /> (i) isomerization.<br /> 2 For the purposes of heading Nos 2710, 2711 and 2712, the ‘specific processes' are the following:<br /> (a) vacuum distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process (2)<br /> (c) cracking;<br /> (d) reforming;<br /> (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f) the process comprising all the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum<br /> or sulphuric anhydride; neutralization with alkaline agents; decolorization and purification with naturally<br /> active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;<br /> (g) polymerization;<br /> (h) alkylation;<br /> (i) isomerization;<br /> (j) in respect of heavy oils falling within heading No ex 2710 only, desulphurization with hydrogen resulting<br /> in a reduction of at least 85 per cent of the sulphur content of the products processed (ASTM D 1266-59<br /> T method);<br /> (1) This example is given for the purpose of explanation only.

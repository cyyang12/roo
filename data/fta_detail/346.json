The first column<br /> gives the heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonized System and<br /> the second column gives the description of goods used in that system for that<br /> heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns a rule is specified in<br /> columns 3 or 4. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by<br /> an 'ex', this signifies that the rules in columns 3 or 4 apply only to the part of that<br /> heading as described in column 2.<br /> 2.2 Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter<br /> number is given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in<br /> general terms, the adjacent rules in columns 3 or 4 apply to all products which,<br /> under the Harmonized System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in any of<br /> the headings grouped together in column 1.<br /> 2.3 Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a<br /> heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by<br /> the adjacent rules in columns 3 or 4.<br /> 2.4 Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns 3<br /> and 4, the exporter may opt, as an alternative, to apply either the rule set out in<br /> column 3 or that set out in column 4. If no origin rule is given in column 4, the<br /> rule set out in column 3 has to be applied.<br /> 1<br /> Amended by Decision No 1 of 2010 (15 September 2010). The Decision will enter into force<br /> when the instruments of acceptance have been deposited by all Parties with the Depositary. The<br /> legal text of this Annex will then be replaced.<br /> Note 3:<br /> 3.1 The provisions of Article 6 of the Protocol concerning products having acquired<br /> originating status which are used in the manufacture of other products apply<br /> regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where these<br /> products are used or in another factory in a Contracting Party.<br /> Example:<br /> An engine of heading No 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-<br /> originating materials which may be incorporated may not exceed 40 per cent of the<br /> ex-works price, is made from \"other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging\" of<br /> heading No ex 7224.<br /> If this forging has been forged in the Contracting Party concerned from a non-<br /> originating ingot, it has already acquired originating status by virtue of the rule for<br /> heading No ex 7224 in the list. The forging can then count as originating in the<br /> value calculation for the engine regardless of whether it was produced in the same<br /> factory or in another factory in the Contracting Party concerned. The value of the<br /> non-originating ingot is thus not taken into account when adding up the value of<br /> the non-originating materials used.<br /> 3.2 The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing<br /> required and the carrying out of more working or processing also confers<br /> originating status; conversely, the carrying out of less working or processing<br /> cannot confer originating status. Thus if a rule provides that non-originating<br /> material at a certain level of manufacture may be used, the use of such material at<br /> an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed and the use of such material at a later<br /> stage is not.<br /> 3.3 Without prejudice to Note 3.2 where a rule states that \"materials of any heading\"<br /> may be used, materials of the same heading as the product may also be used,<br /> subject, however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in the<br /> rule. However, the expression \"manufacture from materials of any heading,<br /> including other materials of heading No ... \" means that only materials classified in<br /> the same heading as the product of a different description than that of the product<br /> as given in column 2 of the list may be used.<br /> 3.4 When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more<br /> than one material, this means that any one or more materials may be used. It does<br /> not require that all be used.<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for fabrics of heading No 5208 to 5212 provides that natural fibres may be<br /> used and that chemical materials, among other materials, may also be used. This<br /> does not mean that both have to be used; it is possible to use one or the other or<br /> both.<br /> 3.5 Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a<br /> particular material, the condition obviously does not prevent the use of other<br /> materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule. (See also<br /> Note 6.2 below in relation to textiles).<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for prepared foods of heading No 1904 which specifically excludes the<br /> use of cereals and their derivatives does not prevent the use of mineral salts,<br /> chemicals and other additives which are not products from cereals.<br /> However, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be<br /> manufactured from the particular material specified in the list, can be produced<br /> from a material of the same nature at an earlier stage of manufacture.<br /> Example:<br /> In the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 made from non-woven<br /> materials, if the use of only non-originating yarn is allowed for this class of article,<br /> it is not possible to start from non-woven cloth - even if non-woven cloths cannot<br /> normally be made from yarn. In such cases, the starting material would normally<br /> be at the stage before yarn - that is the fibre stage.<br /> 3.6 Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of<br /> non-originating materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be<br /> added together. In other words, the maximum value of all the non-originating<br /> materials used may never exceed the highest of the percentages given.<br /> Furthermore, the individual percentages must not be exceeded in relation to the<br /> particular materials they apply to.<br /> Note 4:<br /> 4.1 The term \"natural fibres\" is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or<br /> synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including<br /> waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres that have been carded,<br /> combed or otherwise processed but not spun.<br /> 4.2 The term \"natural fibres\" includes horsehair of heading No 0503, silk of heading<br /> Nos 5002 and 5003 as well as the wool fibres, fine or coarse animal hair of heading<br /> Nos 5101 to 5105, the cotton fibres of heading Nos 5201 to 5203 and the other<br /> vegetable fibres of heading Nos 5301 to 5305.<br /> 4.3 The terms \"textile pulp\", \"chemical materials\" and \"paper-making materials\" are<br /> used in the list to describe the materials not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which<br /> can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.<br /> 4.4 The term \"man-made staple fibres\" is used in the list to refer to synthetic or<br /> artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of heading Nos 5501 to 5507.<br /> Note 5:<br /> 5.1 Where for a given product in the list a reference is made to this note, the conditions<br /> set out in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials, used in the<br /> manufacture of this product, which, taken together, represent 10 per cent or less of<br /> the total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 5.3 and 5.4<br /> below).<br /> 5.2 However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 5.1 may only be applied to mixed<br /> products which have been made from two or more basic textile materials.<br /> The following are the basic textile materials:<br /> - silk,<br /> - wool,<br /> - coarse animal hair,<br /> - fine animal hair,<br /> - horsehair,<br /> - cotton,<br /> - paper-making materials and paper,<br /> - flax,<br /> - true hemp,<br /> - jute and other textile bast fibres,<br /> - sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave,<br /> - coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,<br /> - synthetic man-made filaments,<br /> - artificial man-made filaments,<br /> - current conducting filaments,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyphenylene sulphide,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyvinyl chloride,<br /> - other synthetic man-made staple fibres,<br /> - artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose,<br /> - other artificial man-made staple fibres,<br /> - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether<br /> whether or not gimped,<br /> - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester<br /> whether or not gimped,<br /> - products of heading No 5605 (metallized yarn) incorporating strip consisting of<br /> a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with<br /> aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a<br /> transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film ,<br /> - other products of heading No 5605.<br /> Example:<br /> A yarn of heading No 5205 made from cotton fibres of heading No 5203 and<br /> synthetic staple fibres of heading No 5506 is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-<br /> originating synthetic staple fibres that do not satisfy the origin rules (which require<br /> manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) may be used up to a weight<br /> of 10 per cent of the yarn.<br /> Example:<br /> A woollen fabric of heading No 5112 made from woollen yarn of heading No 5107<br /> and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading No 5509 is a mixed fabric. Therefore<br /> synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture<br /> from chemical materials or textile pulp) or woollen yarn that does not satisfy the<br /> origin rules (which require manufacture from natural fibres, not carded or combed<br /> or otherwise prepared for spinning) or a combination of the two may be used<br /> provided their total weight does not exceed 10 per cent of the weight of the fabric.<br /> Example:<br /> Tufted textile fabric of heading No 5802 made from cotton yarn of heading No<br /> 5205 and cotton fabric of heading No 5210 is only a mixed product if the cotton<br /> fabric is itself a mixed fabric being made from yarns classified in two separate<br /> headings or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.<br /> Example:<br /> If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading<br /> No 5205 and synthetic fabric of heading No 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used<br /> are two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is accordingly a<br /> mixed product.<br /> 5.3 In the case of products incorporating \"yarn made of polyurethane segmented with<br /> flexible segments of polyether whether or not gimped\" this tolerance is 20 per cent<br /> in respect of this yarn.<br /> 5.4 In the case of products incorporating \"strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil<br /> or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a<br /> width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of an adhesive between two<br /> films of plastic film\", this tolerance is 30 per cent in respect of this strip.<br /> Note 6:<br /> 6.1 In the case of those textile products which are marked in the list by a footnote<br /> referring to this note, textile materials, with the exception of linings and<br /> interlinings, which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the<br /> made-up product concerned may be used provided that they are classified in a<br /> heading other than that of the product and that their value does not exceed 8 per<br /> cent of the ex-works price of the product.<br /> 6.2 Without prejudice to Note 6.3, materials which are not classified within Chapters<br /> 50 to 63 may be used freely in the manufacture of textile products, whether or not<br /> they contain textiles.<br /> Example:<br /> If a rule in the list provides that for a particular textile item, such as trousers, yarn<br /> must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because<br /> buttons are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63. For the same reason, it does<br /> not prevent the use of slide-fasteners even though slide-fasteners normally contain<br /> textiles.<br /> 6.3 Where a percentage rule applies, the value of materials which are not classified<br /> within Chapters 50 to 63 must be taken into account when calculating the value of<br /> the non-originating materials incorporated.<br /> Note 7<br /> 7.1 For the purposes of heading Nos ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex<br /> 3403, the \"specific processes\" are the following:<br /> (a) vacuum distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;<br /> (c) cracking;<br /> (d) reforming;<br /> (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f) the process comprising all the following operations: processing with<br /> concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride;

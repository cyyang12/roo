For the purpose of Article D-03, in determining whether motor vehicles produced <br /> by a motor vehicle producer in the territory of a Party and imported into the territory <br /> of the other Party qualify as originating goods, the producer may average its <br /> calculation of the regional value content of a class of motor vehicles or a model line <br /> of motor vehicles produced in a fiscal year in the territory of a Party (@^@the territory of <br /> production@^@) by that producer for sale in the territory of the other Party with the <br /> calculation of the regional value content of the corresponding class of motor vehicles <br /> or model line of motor vehicles produced in the territory of production by a related <br /> producer in the fiscal year that corresponds most closely to the producer's fiscal <br /> year, provided that: <br /> a. the related group acquires 75 per cent or more by unit of quantity of the class of <br /> motor vehicles or model line of motor vehicles, as the case may be, that the <br /> producer has produced in the territory of a Party in that fiscal year for sale in the <br /> territory of the other Party; <br /> b. the producer and the related producer each produced motor vehicles in the <br /> territory of the same Party at any time up to two years from the date of coming into <br /> force of this Agreement; and <br /> c. where a producer otherwise qualifies under this Annex, notice of such qualification <br /> has been provided by the Party referred to in paragraph (b) to the other Party no <br /> later than two years from the date of coming into force of this Agreement. <br /> 2. If the related group acquires less than 75 per cent by unit by quantity of the class <br /> of motor vehicles or model line of motor vehicles, as the case may be, that the <br /> producer has produced in the territory of a Party in that fiscal year for sale in the <br /> territory of the other Party, the producer may average in the manner set out in <br /> paragraph 1 only those motor vehicles that are acquired by the related producer for <br /> distribution under the marque of either the producer or the related group. <br /> 3. In calculating the regional value content of motor vehicles produced by the <br /> producer in the territory of a Party, the producer may choose to average the <br /> calculation in paragraph 1 or 2 over a period of two fiscal years in the event that any <br /> motor vehicle assembly plant operated by the producer or any motor vehicle <br /> assembly plant operated by the related producer with which the producer is <br /> averaging its regional value content is closed for more than two consecutive months: <br /> a. for the purpose of re-tooling for a model change, or <br /> b. as the result of any event or circumstance (other than the imposition of anti- <br /> dumping and countervailing duties, or an interruption of operations resulting from <br /> a labour strike, lock-out, labour dispute, picketing or boycott of or by employees), <br /> that the producer or the related producer could not reasonably have been <br /> expected to avert by corrective action or by exercise of due care and diligence, <br /> including a shortage of materials, failure of utilities, or inability to obtain or delay <br /> in obtaining raw materials, parts, fuel or utilities. <br /> The averaging may be for the producer's fiscal year in which a motor vehicle <br /> producer's or a related producer's plant with which the producer is averaging is <br /> closed and either theprevious or subsequent fiscal year. In the event that the period <br /> of closure spans two fiscal years, the averaging may be only for those two fiscal years. <br /> 4. For the purposes of this Annex, where as a result of an amalgamation, <br /> reorganization, division or similar transaction: <br /> a. a motor vehicle producer (the @^@successor producer@^@) acquires all or <br /> substantially all of the assets used by the related group; and <br /> b. the successor producer, directly or indirectly controls, or is controlled by, the <br /> related group, or both the successor producer and the related group are <br /> controlled by the same person, <br /> the successor producer shall be deemed to be the related producer. <br /> 5. For the purposes of this Annex: <br /> a. a motor vehicle producer is related to another motor vehicle producer when it <br /> owns 50 per cent or more of the common voting stock of the other motor vehicle <br /> producer at the beginning of the other motor vehicle producer's fiscal year; <br /> b. marque means the trade name used by a separate marketing division of a <br /> producer of motor vehicles and any related persons or joint ventures in which <br /> the producer participates; <br /> c. producer means a motor vehicle producer; <br /> d. related group means a related producer and any subsidiary directly or <br /> indirectly owned by it or by any combination thereof; and <br /> e. related producer means a motor vehicle producer that is related to another <br /> motor vehicle producer within the meaning of subparagraph (a). <br /> [Customs administration]: <br /> Chapter E - Customs Procedures <br /> Section I - Certification of Origin", "ProvisionValueCssClass": "", "ProvisionDisplayCssClass": null}, {"ProvisionAbbrev": "indir", "ProvisionCode": "Indirect materials", "ProvisionValue": "included", "ProvisionRank": null, "ProvisionGlossary": "A provision which specifies that the origin of certain materials (referred to as indirect or neutral) used in the production process should not be taken into account when determining the origin of the final good.", "ProvisionGlossaryLink": "/en/glossary?uid=indir&returnto=gloscenter", "ProvisionLegalExtract": "Article D-08: Indirect Materials <br /> An indirect material shall be considered to be an originating material without regard <br /> to where it is produced.", "ProvisionValueCssClass": "green", "ProvisionDisplayCssClass": null}, {"ProvisionAbbrev": "trans", "ProvisionCode": "Direct transport", "ProvisionValue": "included", "ProvisionRank": null, "ProvisionGlossary": "A provision requiring goods that are claiming preferential treatment under an FTA to be shipped directly from the FTA country of origin to the FTA country of destination.", "ProvisionGlossaryLink": "/en/glossary?uid=trans&returnto=gloscenter", "ProvisionLegalExtract": "Article D-11: Transshipment <br /> A good shall not be considered to be an originating good by reason of having <br /> undergone production that satisfies the requirements of Article D-01 if, subsequent to <br /> that production, the good undergoes further production or any other operation <br /> outside the territories of the Parties, other than unloading, reloading or any other <br /> operation necessary to preserve it in good condition or to transport the good to the <br /> territory of a Party.", "ProvisionValueCssClass": "green", "ProvisionDisplayCssClass": null}, {"ProvisionAbbrev": "terr", "ProvisionCode": "Principle of Territoriality", "ProvisionValue": "included", "ProvisionRank": null, "ProvisionGlossary": "A provision stating that for the purpose of determining the origin of goods, all working and processing needs to be carried out within the territory of parties to the agreement without interruption.", "ProvisionGlossaryLink": "/en/glossary?uid=terr&returnto=gloscenter", "ProvisionLegalExtract": "Article D-01: Originating Goods <br /> Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, a good shall originate in the territory of <br /> a Party where: <br /> a. the good is wholly obtained or produced entirely in the territory of one or both of <br /> the Parties, as defined in Article D-16;

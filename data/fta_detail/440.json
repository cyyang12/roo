This Agreement shall apply to any article if: <br> (a) that article is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of a party or is a new or <br> different article of commerce that has been grown, produced, or manufactured in a Party; <br> (b) that article is imported directly from one Party into the other Party; and <br> (c) the sum of (i) the cost or value of the materials produced in the exporting Party, plus (ii) <br> the direct costs of processing operations performed in the exporting Party is not less than 35 percent <br> of the appraised value of the article at the time it is entered into the other Party. <br> 2. No article shall be considered a new or different article of commerce under this Agreement and no <br> material shall be eligible for inclusion as domestic content under this Agreement by virtue of having <br> merely undergone (1) simple combining or packaging operations or (2) mere dilution with water or <br> with another substance that does not materially alter the characteristics of the article or material. <br> 3. For the purposes of this Agreement, the expression @^@wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of a Party@^@ <br> refers both to any article which has been entirely grown, produced, or manufactured in a Party and to all <br> materials incorporated in an article which have been entirely grown, produced, or manufactured in a Party, as <br> distinguished from articles or materials imported into a Party from a non-participating country, whether or not <br> such articles or materials were substantially transformed into new or different articles of commerce after their <br> importation into the Party. <br> 4. For the purposes of this Agreement, @^@country of origin@^@ requires that an article or material, not wholly the <br> growth, product, or manufacture, of a Party, be substantially transformed into a new and different article of <br> commerce, having a new name, character, or use, distinct from the article or material from which it was so <br> transformed. <br> 5. For purposes of determining the 35 percent domestic content requirement under this Agreement, the cost or <br> value of materials which are used in the production of an article in one Party, and which are products of the <br> other Party, may be counted in an amount up to 15 percent of the appraised value of the article. Such <br> materials must in fact be products of the importing Party under the country of origin criteria set forth in this <br> Agreement. <br> 6. (a) For the purposes of this Agreement, the cost or value of materials produced in a Party includes: <br> (i) The manufacturer's actual cost for the materials; <br> (ii) When not included in the manufacturer's actual cost for the materials, the freight, insurance, packing, and <br> all other costs incurred in transporting the materials to the manufacturer's plant ` <br> (iii) The actual cost of waste or spoilage (material list), less the value of recoverable scrap; and <br> (iv) axes and/or duties imposed on the materials by a Party, provided they are not remitted upon exportation. <br> (b) Where a material is provided to the manufacturer without charge, or at less than fair market value, its cost <br> or value shall be determined by computing the sum of: <br> (i) All expenses incurred in the growth, production, or manufacture of the material, including general <br> expenses; <br> (ii) An amount for profit; and <br> (iii) Freight, insurance, packing, and all other costs incurred in transporting the material to the manufacturer's <br> plant. If the pertinent information needed to compute the cost or value of a material is not available, the <br> appraising officer may ascertain or estimate the value thereof using all reasonable ways and means at his <br> disposal. <br> 7. For the purposes of this Agreement, direct costs of processing operations performed in a Party mean those <br> costs either directly incurred in, or which can be reasonably allocated to, the growth, production, <br> manufacture, or assembly, of the specific article under consideration. Such costs include, but are not limited <br> to the following, to the extent that they are includible in the appraised value of articles imported into a Party: <br> (a) all actual labor costs involved in the growth, production, manufacture, or assembly, of the specific <br> article, including fringe benefits, on-the-job training, and the cost of engineering, supervisory, quality control, <br> and similar personnel; <br> (b) dies, molds, tooling and depreciation on machinery and equipment which are allocable to the <br> specific article; <br> (c) research, development, design, engineering, and blueprint costs insofar as they are allocable to the <br> specific article; and <br> (d) costs of inspecting and testing the specific article. <br> Those items that are not included as direct costs of processing operations are those which are not directly <br> attributable to the articles under consideration or are not costs of manufacturing the product. These include, <br> but are not limited to: <br> (i) profit; and <br> (ii) general expenses of doing business which are either not allocable to the specific article or are not <br> related to the growth, production, manufacture, or assembly, of the article, such as administrative <br> salaries, casualty and liability insurance, advertising, and salesmen's salaries, commissions, or <br> expenses. <br> 8. For the purposes of this Agreement, @^@imported directly@^@ means: <br> (a) direct shipment from one Party into the other Party without passing through the territory of <br> any intermediate country; or <br> (b) if shipment is through the territory of an intermediate country, the articles in the shipment <br> do not enter into the commerce of any intermediate country and the invoices, bills of lading, and <br> other shipping documents, show the other Party as the final destination; or <br> (c) if shipment is through an intermediate country and the invoices and other documents do <br> not show the other Party as the final destination, then the articles in the shipment, upon arrival in that <br> Party, are imported directly only if they <br> (i) remain under the control of the customs authority in an intermediate country; <br> (ii) do not enter into the commerce of an intermediate country except for the purpose of a sale other <br> than at retail, provided that the articles are imported as a result of the original commercial transaction <br> between the importer and the producer or the latter's sales agent; <br> (iii) have not been subjected to operations other than loading and unloading, and other activities <br> necessary to preserve the article in good condition; and <br> (iv) comply with the origin requirements for articles exported to a Party from the other Party under <br> this Agreement as stated in the documents required under the certification procedure. <br> 9. All articles entered under this Agreement shall be documented by a certificate, specimens of which <br> are given in the attachment to this Annex, signed by the exporter to be completed in accordance with <br> the rules specified in the certificate. The certificate should contain sufficient information to identify <br> the articles described on the certificate as the articles to be exported and a statement as to the <br> percentage of value added in a Party and that the articles comply with the country of origin <br> requirements set forth in this Agreement. The certificate will be presented to the Customs authorities <br> of the importing Party in accordance with its internal regulations. <br> Notwithstanding the above, either Party may waive production of the certificate on a case by case <br> basis for articles imported into such Party and for which the benefits of this Agreement are claimed, <br> if the Party is otherwise satisfied that the imported articles comply with the country of origin <br> requirements set forth in this Agreement. <br> The exporter or person signing the certificate of origin shall be prepared to submit a declaration <br> setting forth all pertinent details, concerning the production or manufacture of the articles, which <br> were used to prepare the certificate of origin. The information on the declaration should contain at <br> least the following pertinent details: <br> A. a description of the article, quantity, numbers and marks of packages, invoice numbers, and <br> bills of lading; <br> B. a description of the operations performed in the production of the article in a Party and <br> identification of the direct costs of processing operations; <br> C. a description of any materials used in production of the article which are wholly the growth, <br> product, or manufacture of either Party, and a statement as to the cost or value of such materials; <br> D. a description of the operations performed on, and a statement as to the origin and cost or <br> value of, any foreign materials used in the article which are claimed to have been sufficiently <br> processed in a Party so as to be materials produced in that Party; and <br> E. a description of the origin and cost or value of any foreign materials used in the article which <br> have not been substantially transformed in a Party. <br> This declaration shall be prepared and submitted upon request by a Party. A declaration should <br> only be requested when a Party has reason to question the accuracy of the statements on a certificate <br> of origin, or when a Party randomly verifies certificates of origin. <br> 10. In order to further the administration of this Agreement, the Parties agree to assist each other in <br> obtaining information for the purpose of reviewing transactions made under this Agreement in order <br> to verify compliance with the conditions set forth in this Agreement. <br> 11. The Parties will consult from time to time on the interpretation of these provisions and on <br> practical problems which may arise with a view to prevent unnecessary barriers to trade which are <br> inconsistent with the objectives of this Agreement. In this connection, amendments of the present <br> rules could be proposed. <br> Public Law 104-234 <br> 104th Congress <br> An Act <br> To amend the United States-Israel Free Trade Area Implementation Act of 1985 <br> to provide the President with additional proclamation authority with respect <br> to articles of the West Bank or Gaza Strip or a qualifying industrial zone. <br> Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of <br> the United States of America in Congress assembled, <br> SECTION I.

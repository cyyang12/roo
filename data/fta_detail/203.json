Chemical Reaction Origin Rule:<br /> Notwithstanding the applicable product specific rules of origin, any good of<br /> Chapters 27 to 40 that is the product of a chemical reaction shall be considered to be an<br /> originating good if the chemical reaction occurred in the territory of a Party.<br /> For the purposes of this Section, a \"chemical reaction\" is a process (including a<br /> biochemical process) which results in a molecule with a new structure by breaking<br /> intramolecular bonds and by forming new intramolecular bonds, or by altering the<br /> spatial arrangement of atoms in a molecule.<br /> The following are not considered to be chemical reactions for the purposes of<br /> determining whether a good is an originating good:<br /> (a)    dissolving in water or other solvents;<br /> (b)    the elimination of solvents including solvent water; or<br /> (c)    the addition or elimination of water of crystallization.<br /> 8.    Purification Origin Rule:<br /> Notwithstanding the applicable product specific rules of origin, for the purposes<br /> of Chapters 28 to 35, 38 and 39, purification is considered to be origin conferring if it<br /> occurred in the territory of a Party, provided that one of the following criteria is satisfied:<br /> (a)    purification of a good results in the elimination of not less than 80 percent of the<br /> content of existing impurities; or<br /> (b)    the reduction or elimination of impurities results in a good suitable for one or<br /> more of the following applications:<br /> (i)    pharmaceutical, medicinal, cosmetic, veterinary, or food grade substances;<br /> (ii)    chemical products and reagents for analytical, diagnostic or laboratory uses;<br /> (iii)    elements and components for use in micro-elements;<br /> (iv)    specialized optical uses;<br /> (v)    non-toxic uses for health and safety;<br /> (vi)    biotechnical use;<br /> (vii)    carriers used in a separation process;    or<br /> (viii)    nuclear grade uses.<br /> 9.    Mixtures and Blends Origin Rule:<br /> Notwithstanding the applicable product specific rules of origin, for the purposes<br /> of Chapters 30 and 31, heading 3302, subheading 3502.20, and headings 3506, 3507<br /> and 3707, the deliberate and proportionally controlled mixing or blending (including<br /> dispersing) of materials to conform to predetermined specifications, which results in the<br /> production of a good having physical or chemical characteristics which are relevant to<br /> the purposes or uses of the good and are different from the input materials, is considered<br /> to be origin conferring if it occurred in the territory of a Party.<br /> 10.    Change in Particle Size Origin Rule:<br /> Notwithstanding the applicable product specific rules of origin, for the purposes<br /> of Chapters 30, 31 and 39, the deliberate and controlled modification in particle size of<br /> a good, other than by crushing or pressing, resulting in a good having a defined particle<br /> size, defined particle size distribution or defined surface area which is relevant to the<br /> purposes of the resulting good and having different physical or chemical characteristics<br /> from the input materials, is considered to be origin conferring if it occurred in the<br /> territory of a Party.<br /> 11.    Standards Materials Origin Rule:<br /> Notwithstanding the applicable product specific rules of origin, for the purposes<br /> of Chapters 28 to 32, 35 and 38, the production of standards materials is considered to<br /> be origin conferring if it occurred in the territory of a Party. For the purposes of this rule,<br /> \"standards materials\" (including standard solutions) are preparations suitable for<br /> analytical, calibrating or referencing uses having precise degrees of purity or<br /> proportions which are certified by the manufacturer.<br /> 12.    Isomer Separation Origin Rule:<br /> Notwithstanding the applicable product specific rules of origin, for the purposes<br /> of Chapters 28 to 32, 35 and 39, the isolation or separation of isomers from mixtures of<br /> isomers is considered to be origin conferring if it occurred in the territory of a Party.<br /> 13. Distillation Rule:<br /> Notwithstanding the applicable product specific rules of origin, for the purposes<br /> of heading 27.10, the following processes confer origin if the process occurred in the<br /> territory of a Party:<br /> (a)    Atmospheric distillation - a separation process in which petroleum oils are<br /> converted, in a distillation tower, into fractions according to boiling point and the<br /> vapour then condensed into different liquefied fractions. Goods produced from<br /> petroleum distillation may include liquefied petroleum gas, naphtha, gasoline, kerosene,<br /> diesel/heating oil, light gas oils, and lubricating oil; or<br /> (b)    Vacuum distillation - distillation at a pressure below atmospheric but not so low<br /> that it would be classed as molecular distillation. Vacuum distillation is useful for<br /> distilling high-boiling and heat-sensitive materials such as heavy distillates in petroleum<br /> oils to produce light to heavy vacuum gas oils and residuum. In some refineries, gas oils<br /> may be further processed into lubricating oils.", "ShowProductAffected": false, "ProductAffected": null, "RevisionName": null, "Rank": 0, "ShowRooExceptions": false, "RooExceptions": null}], "SpecificNote": [{"RooCode": null, "RooText": null, "ShowProductAffected": false, "ProductAffected": null, "RevisionName": null, "Rank": 0, "ShowRooExceptions": false, "RooExceptions": null}], "Documents": [{"DocDesc": "Certificate of origin", "DocFileName": "itc00209_coo.pdf", "DocType": "1_coo", "WebLink": "https://dfat.gov.au/trade/agreements/in-force/chafta/fact-sheets/Documents/chafta-certificate-of-origin-sample-template-originals-supplied-by-authorised-bodies.pdf"}, {"DocDesc": "Product-specific rules of origin", "DocFileName": "itc00209_sroo.pdf", "DocType": "2_sroo", "WebLink": "https://dfat.gov.au/trade/agreements/in-force/chafta/official-documents/Documents/chafta-annex-ii-product-specific-rules-of-origin.pdf"}, {"DocDesc": "Chapter on rules of origin", "DocFileName": "itc00209_roo.pdf", "DocType": "3_roo", "WebLink": "https://dfat.gov.au/trade/agreements/in-force/chafta/official-documents/Documents/chafta-chapter-3-rules-of-origin-and-implementation-procedures.pdf"}, {"DocDesc": "Customs administration", "DocFileName": "itc00209_cusa.pdf", "DocType": "5_cusa", "WebLink": "https://dfat.gov.au/trade/agreements/in-force/chafta/official-documents/Documents/chafta-chapter-4-customs-procedures-and-trade-facilitation.pdf"}, {"DocDesc": "Full text of agreement", "DocFileName": "itc00209_full.pdf", "DocType": "8_full", "WebLink": "https://dfat.gov.au/trade/agreements/in-force/chafta/official-documents/Pages/official-documents.aspx"}, {"DocDesc": "WTO notification", "DocFileName": "itc00209_wto.pdf", "DocType": "9_wto", "WebLink": "https://docs.wto.org/dol2fe/Pages/SS/directdoc.aspx?filename=q:/G/RO/N137.pdf"}]}, "FtaProvisions": {"RooProvision": [{"ProvisionAbbrev": "accum", "ProvisionCode": "Cumulation", "ProvisionValue": "bilateral", "ProvisionRank": null, "ProvisionGlossary": "A provision which allows to consider goods obtained in as well as processing taking place in one FTA member country as originating in another.", "ProvisionGlossaryLink": "/en/glossary?uid=accum&returnto=gloscenter", "ProvisionLegalExtract": "ARTICLE 3.6: CUMULATION <br /> Originating material from the territory of a Party used in the production of a <br /> good in the territory of the other Party shall be considered to originate in the territory of <br /> the other Party.", "ProvisionValueCssClass": "", "ProvisionDisplayCssClass": null}, {"ProvisionAbbrev": "demin", "ProvisionCode": "De Minimis", "ProvisionValue": "included (10%)", "ProvisionRank": null, "ProvisionGlossary": "A provision that allows a small amount of non-originating materials to be used in the production of the good without affecting its originating status.

There are four different types of rules,<br /> which vary according to the product:<br /> (a) through working or processing a maximum content of non-originating materials is not<br /> exceeded;<br /> (b) through working or processing the four-digit HS heading or six-digit HS subheading of the<br /> manufactured products becomes different from the four-digit HS heading or six-digit HS<br /> subheading, respectively, of the materials used. However, in the case set out in the second<br /> paragraph of point 3.3., the four-digit HS heading or six-digit HS subheading of the<br /> manufactured products may be the same as the four-digit HS heading or six-digit HS<br /> subheading, respectively, of the materials used;<br /> (c) a specific working and processing operation is carried out; or<br /> (d) working or processing is carried out on certain wholly obtained materials.<br /> Note 2 - The Structure of the List of Required Working or Processing<br /> 2.1. The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column gives the<br /> heading number or Chapter number used in the HS and the second column gives the<br /> description of goods used in that system for that heading or Chapter. For each entry in the first<br /> two columns, a rule is specified in column 3. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first<br /> column is preceded by an \"ex\", this signifies that the rules in column 3 apply only to the part<br /> of that heading as described in column 2.<br /> 2.2. Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a Chapter number is<br /> given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the<br /> adjacent rules in column 3 apply to all products which, under the HS, are classified in<br /> headings of the Chapter or in any of the headings grouped together in column 1.<br /> 2.3. Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each<br /> indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rules in<br /> column 3.<br /> 2.4. Where two alternative rules are set out in column 3 that are separated by use of a different line<br /> and linked by an \"or\", it shall be at the choice of the exporter which one to use.<br /> Note 3 - Examples of how to Apply the Rules<br /> 3.1. Article 5 (Sufficiently Worked or Processed Products), concerning products having acquired<br /> originating status which are used in the manufacture of other products, applies, regardless of<br /> whether that status has been acquired inside the factory where those products are used or in<br /> another factory in a Party.<br /> 3.2. Pursuant to Article 6 (Insufficient Working or Processing), the working or processing carried<br /> out must go beyond the list of operations mentioned in that Article. If it does not, the goods<br /> shall not qualify for the granting of the preferential tariff treatment, even if the conditions set<br /> out in the list below are met.<br /> Subject to the first paragraph, the rules in the list represent the minimum amount of working<br /> or processing required. The carrying-out of more working or processing also confers<br /> originating status, without prejudice to Article 6 (Insufficient Working or Processing).<br /> Conversely, the carrying-out of less working or processing shall not confer originating status.<br /> 3.3. Where a rule uses the expression \"Manufacture from materials of any heading, except that of<br /> the product\" all non-originating materials classified in headings other than that of the product<br /> may be used (Change in Tariff Heading).<br /> Where a rule uses the expression \"Manufacture from materials of any heading\", then materials<br /> of any heading(s) (even materials of the same description and heading as the product) may be<br /> used.<br /> 3.4. Where a rule uses the expression \"Manufacture in which the value of all the materials used<br /> does not exceed x % of the ex-works price of the product\" then the value of all<br /> non-originating materials is to be considered and the percentage for the maximum value of<br /> non-originating materials may not be exceeded through the use of paragraph 3 of Article 5<br /> (Sufficiently Worked or Processed Products).<br /> 3.5 If a rule provides that a specific non-originating material may be used, the use of materials<br /> which are still in an earlier stage of the manufacturing process of that specific material is<br /> allowed, and the use of materials resulting from further processing of that specific non-<br /> originating material is not.<br /> If a rule provides that a specific non-originating material may not be used, the use of materials<br /> which are still in an earlier stage of the manufacturing process of that specific non-originating<br /> material is allowed, and the use of materials resulting from further processing of that specific<br /> non-originating material is not.<br /> Example: when the rule for Chapter 19 requires that \"non-originating materials of<br /> headings 1101 to 1108 cannot exceed 20 % of the weight\", the use of non-originating cereals<br /> of Chapter 10 (materials at an earlier stage in the manufacturing process of goods of 1101 to<br /> 1108) is not limited by the requirement concerning the 20 % of the weight.<br /> 3.6. When a rule specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one material, one<br /> or more materials may be used. It does not require that all materials have to be used.<br /> 3.7. Where a rule specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular material, it does<br /> not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy<br /> that requirement.<br /> Example: Flat-rolled products of iron and non-alloy steel, of a width of 600 mm or more,<br /> which have been painted, varnished or coated with plastics are classified in the HS<br /> under 7210 70. The rule for 7210 is \"Manufacture from ingots or other primary forms or<br /> semi-finished materials of heading 7206 and 7207\". This rule does not prevent the use of<br /> non-originating paint and varnish (heading 3208) or plastics (Chapter 39).<br /> Note 4 - General Provisions Concerning certain Agricultural Goods<br /> 4.1. Agricultural goods falling within Chapters 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 12 and heading 2401 which are<br /> grown or harvested in a Party shall be treated as originating in that Party, even if grown from<br /> seeds, bulbs, rootstock, cuttings, grafts, shoots, buds, or other live parts of plants imported<br /> from a non-Party.<br /> 4.2 Whenever the rules for products in Chapters 1 to 24 incorporate some limitations in weight, it<br /> should be noted that in accordance with paragraph 2 of Article 5 (Sufficiently Worked or<br /> Processed Products), those limitations in weight only apply to non-originating materials.<br /> Consequently, originating materials are not to be taken into account for the calculation of the<br /> limitations in weight. In addition, those limitations are expressed in different manners. In<br /> particular:<br /> (a) When the rule uses the expression \"the weight of the materials of Chapters/headings\",<br /> the weight of each material mentioned shall be added up and the total weight shall not<br /> exceed the maximum percentage.<br /> Example: The rule for Chapter 19 provides that the weight of the materials of<br /> Chapters 2, 3 and 16 used does not exceed 20 % of the weight of the final product. In<br /> case the weight of the final product contains 12 % of materials of Chapter 3 and 10 % of<br /> materials of Chapter 16, the product does not meet the origin conferring rule of<br /> Chapter 19 as the combined weight exceeds 20 % of the weight of the final product.<br /> (b) When the rule uses the expression \"the individual weight of the materials of<br /> Chapters/headings\" the weight of each material mentioned shall not exceed the<br /> maximum percentage. The combined weight of the materials added together has no<br /> relevance.<br /> Example: The rule for Chapter 22 provides that the individual weight of sugar and of<br /> the materials of Chapter 4 does not exceed 20 % of the weight of the final product. In<br /> case the weight of the final product contains 15 % of sugar as well as 10 % of materials<br /> of Chapter 4, the origin conferring rule of Chapter 22 is complied with. Each individual<br /> material is less than 20 % of the weight of the final product. On the contrary, in case the<br /> weight of the final product contains 25 % of sugar and 10 % of materials of Chapter 4,<br /> the origin conferring rule is not met.<br /> (c) When the rule uses the expression \"the total combined weight of sugar and of the<br /> materials of Chapter 4 does not exceed x % of the weight of the final product\", both the<br /> weight of the sugar and the materials of Chapter 4 shall meet individually their weight<br /> limitation, and their combined weights added up shall meet the combined weight<br /> limitation. A combined weight limitation expresses a further restriction to the individual<br /> weight limitations.<br /> Example: The rule for heading 1704 provides that the combined weight of sugar and of<br /> the materials of Chapter 4 does not exceed 50 % of the weight of the final product. The<br /> individual weight limitations for materials of Chapter 4 are 20 % and for sugar 40 %. In<br /> case the weight of the final product contains 35 % of sugar and 15 % of materials of<br /> Chapter 4, both the individual weight limitations and the combined weight limitations of<br /> the origin conferring rule of heading 1704 are complied with. On the contrary, in case<br /> the weight of the final product contains 35 % of sugar and 20 % of materials of Chapter<br /> 4, the combined weight represents 55 % of the weight of the final product. In that case<br /> the individual weight limitations are respected but the combined weight limitation is<br /> exceeded and therefore the origin conferring rule of heading 1704 is not complied with.<br /> Note 5 - Terminology Used in Respect of certain Textile Products<br /> 5.1. The term \"natural fibres\" is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic<br /> fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless<br /> otherwise specified, includes fibres which have been carded, combed or otherwise processed,<br /> but not spun.<br /> 5.2. The term \"natural fibres\" includes horsehair of heading 0511, silk of headings 5002 and 5003,<br /> as well as wool-fibres and fine or coarse animal hair of headings 5101 to 5105, cotton fibres<br /> of headings 5201 to 5203, and other vegetable fibres of headings 5301 to 5305.<br /> 5.3. The terms \"textile pulp\", \"chemical materials\" and \"paper-making materials\" are used in the<br /> list to describe the materials, not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to<br /> manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.<br /> 5.4. The term \"man-made staple fibres\" is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament<br /> tow, staple fibres or waste of headings 5501 to 5507.<br /> Note 6 - Tolerances Applicable to Products Made of a Mixture of Textile Materials<br /> 6.1. Where, for a given product in the list, reference is made to this Note, the conditions set out in<br /> column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials used in the manufacture of this<br /> product and which, taken together, represent 10 % or less of the total weight of all the basic<br /> textile materials used. (See also Notes 6.3 and 6.4).<br /> 6.2. However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 6.1 may be applied only to mixed products which<br /> have been made from two or more basic textile materials.<br /> The following are the basic textile materials:<br /> - silk;<br /> - wool;<br /> - coarse animal hair;<br /> - fine animal hair;<br /> - horsehair;<br /> - cotton;<br /> - paper-making materials and paper;<br /> - flax;<br /> - true hemp;<br /> - jute and other textile bast fibres;<br /> - sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave;<br /> - coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres;<br /> synthetic man-made filaments;<br /> artificial man-made filaments;<br /> current-conducting filaments;<br /> synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene;<br /> synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester;<br /> synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide;<br /> synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile;<br /> synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide;<br /> synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene;<br /> synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(phenylene sulphide);<br /> synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(vinyl chloride);<br /> other synthetic man-made staple fibres;<br /> - artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose;<br /> - other artificial man-made staple fibres;<br /> - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or<br /> not gimped;<br /> - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester, whether or<br /> not gimped;<br /> - products of heading 5605 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core of<br /> aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium<br /> powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or<br /> coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film;<br /> - other products of heading 5605;<br /> - glass fibres;<br /> - metal fibres.<br /> Example: A yarn of heading 5205, made from cotton fibres of heading 5203 and synthetic<br /> staple fibres of heading 5506, is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple<br /> fibres which do not satisfy the origin rules may be used, provided that their total weight does<br /> not exceed 10 % of the weight of the yarn.<br /> Example: A woollen fabric of heading 5112, made from woollen yarn of heading 5107 and<br /> synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading 5509, is a mixed fabric. Therefore, synthetic yarn<br /> which does not satisfy the origin rules, or woollen yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules,<br /> or a combination of the two, may be used, provided that their total weight does not<br /> exceed 10 % of the weight of the fabric.<br /> Example: Tufted textile fabric of heading 5802, made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and<br /> cotton fabric of heading 5210, is only a mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed<br /> fabric made from yarns classified in two separate headings, or if the cotton yarns used are<br /> themselves mixtures.<br /> Example: If the tufted textile fabric concerned was made from cotton yarn of heading 5205<br /> and synthetic fabric of heading 5407, the yarns used are two separate basic textile materials<br /> and the tufted textile fabric is, accordingly, a mixed product.<br /> 6.3. In the case of products incorporating \"yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible<br /> segments of polyether, whether or not gimped\", this tolerance is 20 % in respect of this yarn.<br /> 6.4. In the case of products incorporating \"strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core<br /> of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm,<br /> sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic<br /> film\", this tolerance is 30 % in respect of this strip.<br /> Note 7 - Other Tolerances Applicable to certain Textile Products<br /> 7.1. Where, in the list, reference is made to this Note, textile materials which do not satisfy the<br /> rule set out in the list in column 3 for the made-up product concerned, may be used, provided<br /> that they are classified in a heading other than that of the product and that their value does not<br /> exceed 8 % of the ex-works price of the product.<br /> 7.2. Without prejudice to Note 7.3, materials, which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63,<br /> may be used freely in the manufacture of textile products, whether or not they contain textiles.<br /> Example: If a rule provides that, for a particular textile item (such as trousers), yarn shall be<br /> used, it does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because buttons are not<br /> classified within Chapters 50 to 63. For the same reason, it does not prevent the use of slide-<br /> fasteners, even though slide-fasteners normally contain textiles.<br /> 7.3. Where a percentage rule applies, the value of non-originating materials which are not<br /> classified within Chapters 50 to 63 shall be taken into account when calculating the value of<br /> the non-originating materials incorporated.<br /> Note 8 - Definition of Specific Processes and Simple Operations Carried out in Respect of certain<br /> Products of Chapter 27<br /> 8.1. For the purposes of headings ex 2707 and 2713, the \"specific processes\" are the following:<br /> (a) vacuum-distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;<br /> (c) cracking;<br /> (d) reforming;<br /> (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f) the process comprising all of the following operations: processing with concentrated<br /> sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents;<br /> decolourisation and purification with naturally active earth, activated earth, activated<br /> charcoal or bauxite;<br /> (g) polymerisation;<br /> (h) alkylation; and<br /> (i) isomerisation.<br /> 8.2. For the purposes of headings 2710, 2711 and 2712, the \"specific processes\" are the following:<br /> (a) vacuum-distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;<br /> (c) cracking;<br /> (d) reforming;<br /> (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f) the process comprising all of the following operations: processing with concentrated<br /> sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents;<br /> decolourisation and purification with naturally active earth, activated earth, activated<br /> charcoal or bauxite;<br /> (g) polymerisation;<br /> (h) alkylation;<br /> (i) isomerisation;<br /> (j) in respect of heavy oils of heading ex 2710 only, desulphurisation with hydrogen,<br /> resulting in a reduction of at least 85 % of the sulphur content of the products processed<br /> (ASTM D 1266-59 T method);<br /> (k) in respect of products of heading 2710 only, deparaffining by a process other than<br /> filtering;<br /> (l) in respect of heavy oils of heading ex 2710 only, treatment with hydrogen, at a pressure<br /> of more than 20 bar and a temperature of more than 250 \u00b0C, with the use of a catalyst,", "ShowProductAffected": false, "ProductAffected": null, "RevisionName": null, "Rank": 0, "ShowRooExceptions": false, "RooExceptions": null}], "SpecificNote": [{"RooCode": null, "RooText": null, "ShowProductAffected": false, "ProductAffected": null, "RevisionName": null, "Rank": 0, "ShowRooExceptions": false, "RooExceptions": null}], "Documents": [{"DocDesc": "Certificate of origin", "DocFileName": "itc00405_coo.pdf", "DocType": "1_coo", "WebLink": null}, {"DocDesc": "Product-specific rules of origin", "DocFileName": "itc00405_sroo.pdf", "DocType": "2_sroo", "WebLink": null}, {"DocDesc": "Chapter on rules of origin", "DocFileName": "itc00405_roo.pdf", "DocType": "3_roo", "WebLink": "http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/html/157381.htm"}, {"DocDesc": "Customs administration", "DocFileName": "itc00405_cusa.pdf", "DocType": "5_cusa", "WebLink": "https://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2018/september/tradoc_157349.pdf"}, {"DocDesc": "Full text of agreement", "DocFileName": "itc00405_full.pdf", "DocType": "8_full", "WebLink": "http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/press/index.cfm?id=1437"}]}, "FtaProvisions": {"RooProvision": [{"ProvisionAbbrev": "accum", "ProvisionCode": "Cumulation", "ProvisionValue": "diagonal and cross-cumulation (fabrics)", "ProvisionRank": null, "ProvisionGlossary": "A provision which allows to consider goods obtained in as well as processing taking place in one FTA member country as originating in another.", "ProvisionGlossaryLink": "/en/glossary?uid=accum&returnto=gloscenter", "ProvisionLegalExtract": "Article 3 : Cumulation of Origin <br /> 1 Notwithstanding Article 2 (General Requirements), products shall be considered as <br /> originating in the exporting Party if such products are obtained there by incorporating materials <br /> originating in the other Party, provided that the working or processing carried out in the exporting <br /> Party goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 6 (Insufficient Working or Processing). <br /> 2 Materials listed in Annex III to this Protocol (Materials Referred to in Paragraph 2 of Article 3) <br /> originating in an ASEAN country which applies with the Union a preferential trade <br /> agreement in accordance with Article XXIV of GATT 1994, shall be considered as materials <br /> originating in Viet Nam when further processed or incorporated into one of the products listed in <br /> Annex IV to this Protocol (Products Referred to in Paragraph 2 of Article 3). <br /> 3 For the purpose of paragraph 2, the origin of the materials shall be determined according to <br /> the rules of origin applicable in the framework of the Union's preferential trade agreements with <br /> those ASEAN countries. <br /> 4 For the purpose of paragraph 2, the originating status of materials exported from an ASEAN <br /> country to Viet Nam to be used in further working or processing shall be established by a proof of <br /> origin as if those materials were exported directly to the Union. <br /> 5 The cumulation provided for in paragraphs 2 to 4 applies if: <br /> (a) the ASEAN countries involved in the acquisition of the originating status have undertaken to: <br /> (i) comply or ensure compliance with this Protocol;

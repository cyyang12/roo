The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column gives the heading number or<br /> chapter number used in the Harmonised System and the second column gives the description of goods used in that<br /> system for that heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns a rule is specified in column 3 or 4.<br /> Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an \u2018ex\u00b7, this signifies that the rules in column 3<br /> or 4 apply only to the part of that heading as described in column 2.<br /> 2. Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number is given and the description<br /> of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rules in column 3 or 4 apply to all products<br /> which, under the Harmonised System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in any of the headings grouped<br /> together in column 1.<br /> 3. Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each indent contains the<br /> description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rules in column 3 or 4.<br /> 4. Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns 3 and 4, the exporter may opt to<br /> apply either the rule set out in column 3 or that set out in column 4. If no origin rule is given in column 4, the rule<br /> set out in column 3 has to be applied.<br /> Note 3<br /> 1. The provisions of Article 4 of this Annex concerning products having acquired originating status which are used in<br /> the manufacture of other products apply regardless of whether that status has been acquired inside the factory where<br /> those products are used or in another factory in the Union or in the AC3 States.<br /> Example:<br /> An engine of heading 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-originating materials which may be<br /> incorporated may not exceed 40 % of the ex-works price, is made from \u2018other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging\u00b7<br /> of heading ex 7224.<br /> If that forging has been forged in the Union from a non-originating ingot, it has already acquired originating status<br /> by virtue of the rule for heading ex 7224 in the list. The forging can then count as originating in the value<br /> calculation for the engine regardless of whether it was produced in the same factory or in another factory in the<br /> Union. The value of the non-originating ingot is thus not taken into account when adding up the value of the non-<br /> originating materials used.<br /> 2. The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing required and the carrying out of more<br /> working or processing also confers originating status conversely, the carrying out of less working or processing<br /> cannot confer originating status. Therefore, if a rule provides that non-originating material at a certain level of<br /> manufacture may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed and the use of such<br /> material at a later stage is not.<br /> 3. Without prejudice to Note 3.2, where a rule states that \u2018materials of any heading\u00b7 may be used, materials of the same<br /> heading as the product may also be used, subject, however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained<br /> in the rule. However, the expression \u2018manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of<br /> heading \u2026\u00b7 means that only materials classified in the same heading as the product of a description other than that<br /> of the product as given in column 2 of the list may be used.<br /> 8.7.2016 EN<br /> 4 When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one material, this means that<br /> one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all be used.<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for fabrics of headings 5208 to 5212 provides that natural fibres may be used and those chemical materials,<br /> among other materials, may also be used. This does not mean that both have to be used it is possible to use one or<br /> the other or both.<br /> 5 Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular material, the condition does<br /> not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule. (See also<br /> Note 6.3 below in relation to textiles .<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for prepared foods of heading 1904 which specifically excludes the use of cereals and their derivatives does<br /> not prevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and other additives which are not produced from cereals.<br /> However, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be manufactured from the particular materials<br /> specified in the list, can be produced from a material of the same nature at an earlier stage of manufacture.<br /> Example:<br /> In the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 made from non-woven materials, if the use of only non-<br /> originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is not possible to start from non-woven cloth - even if non-<br /> woven cloths cannot normally be made from yarn. In such cases, the starting material would normally be at the<br /> stage before yarn - that is the fibre stage.<br /> 6 Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of non-originating materials that can<br /> be used, then those percentages may not be added together. In other words, the maximum value of all the non-<br /> originating materials used may never exceed the higher of the percentages given. Furthermore, the individual<br /> percentages must not be exceeded in relation to the particular materials to which they apply.<br /> Note 4<br /> 1. The term \u2018natural fibres\u00b7 is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic fibres. It is restricted to<br /> the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres that have been<br /> carded, combed or otherwise processed but not spun.<br /> 2. The term \u2018natural fibres\u00b7 includes horsehair of heading 0503, silk of headings 5002 and 5003 as well as the wool<br /> fibres, fine or coarse animal hair of headings 5101 to 5105, the cotton fibres of headings 5201 to 5203 and the<br /> other vegetable fibres of headings 5301 to 5305.<br /> 3. The terms \u2018textile pulp\u00b7, \u2018chemical materials\u00b7 and \u2018paper-making materials\u00b7 are used in the list to describe the materials<br /> not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.<br /> 4. The term \u2018man-made staple fibres\u00b7 is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament tow, staple fibres or<br /> waste, of headings 5501 to 5507.<br /> Note 5<br /> 1. Where for a given product in the list a reference is made to this Note, the conditions set out in column 3 shall not be<br /> applied to any basic textile materials, used in the manufacture of that product, which, taken together, represent 10 %<br /> or less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 5.3 and 5.4 below .<br /> 2. However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 5.1 may only be applied to mixed products which have been made from<br /> two or more basic textile materials.<br /> L 185/38 EN<br /> The following are the basic textile materials:<br /> - silk,<br /> - wool,<br /> - coarse animal hair,<br /> - fine animal hair,<br /> - horsehair,<br /> - cotton,<br /> - paper-making materials and paper,<br /> - flax,<br /> - true hemp,<br /> - jute and other textile bast fibres,<br /> - sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave,<br /> - coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,<br /> - synthetic man-made filaments,<br /> - artificial man-made filaments,<br /> - current conducting filaments,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyphenylene sulphide,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyvinyl chloride,<br /> - other synthetic man-made staple fibres,<br /> - artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose,<br /> - other artificial man-made staple fibres,<br /> - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether whether or not gimped,<br /> - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester whether or not gimped,<br /> - products of heading 5605 (metallised yarn incorporating strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core<br /> of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by<br /> means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film,<br /> - other products of heading 5605.<br /> 8.7.2016 EN<br /> Example:<br /> A yarn of heading 5205 made from cotton fibres of heading 5203 and synthetic staple fibres of heading 5506 is a<br /> mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres that do not satisfy the origin rules (which require<br /> manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp may be used up to a weight of 10 % of the yarn.<br /> Example:<br /> A woollen fabric of heading 5112 made from woollen yarn of heading 5107 and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of<br /> heading 5509 is a mixed fabric. Therefore synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules (which require<br /> manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp or woollen yarn that does not satisfy the origin rules (which<br /> require manufacture from natural fibres, not carded or combed or otherwise prepared for spinning or a combination<br /> of the two may be used provided their total weight does not exceed 10 % of the weight of the fabric.<br /> Example:<br /> Tufted textile fabric of heading 5802 made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and cotton fabric of heading 5210 is<br /> only a mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric being made from yarns classified in two separate<br /> headings or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.<br /> Example:<br /> If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and synthetic fabric of<br /> heading 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is<br /> accordingly a mixed product.<br /> 3 In the case of products incorporating \u2018yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether<br /> whether or not gimped\u00b7 the tolerance is 20 % in respect of the yarn.<br /> 4 In the case of products incorporating \u2018strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether<br /> or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of an adhesive<br /> between two layers of plastic film\u00b7, the tolerance is 30 % in respect of the strip.<br /> Note 6<br /> 1. In the case of those textile products, which are marked in the list by a footnote referring to this Introductory Note,<br /> textile trimmings and accessories which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the made up<br /> products concerned may be used provided that their weight does not exceed 10 % of the total weight of all the<br /> textile materials incorporated.<br /> Textile trimmings and accessories are those classified in Chapters 50 to 63. Linings and interlinings are not to be<br /> regarded as trimmings or accessories.<br /> 2. Any non-textile trimmings and accessories or other materials used which contain textiles do not have to satisfy the<br /> conditions set out in column 3 even though they fall outside the scope of Note 3.5.<br /> 3. In accordance with Note 3.5, any non-originating non-textile trimmings and accessories or other product, which do<br /> not contain any textiles, may anyway, be used freely where they cannot be made from the materials listed in<br /> column 3.<br /> For example (1 , if a rule in the list says that for a particular textile item, such as a blouse, yarn must be used, this<br /> does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because they cannot be made from textile materials.<br /> 4. Where a percentage rule applies, the value of trimmings and accessories must be taken into account when calculating<br /> the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.<br /> ( This example is given for the purpose of explanation only.

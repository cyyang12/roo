The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column gives the<br /> heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonized System and the second column<br /> gives the description of goods used in that system for that heading or chapter. For each entry in<br /> the first two columns, a rule is specified in column 3 or 4. Where, in some cases, the entry in the<br /> first column is preceded by an \"ex\", this signifies that the rules in column 3 or 4 apply only to<br /> the part of that heading described in column 2.<br /> 2. Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number is given<br /> and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent<br /> rules in column 3 or 4 apply to all products which, under the Harmonized System, are classified<br /> in headings of the chapter or in any of the headings grouped together in column 1.<br /> 3. Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each<br /> indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rules in<br /> column 3 or 4.<br /> 4. Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns 3 and 4, the<br /> exporter may opt to apply either the rule set out in column 3 or that set out in column 4. If no<br /> origin rule is given in column 4, the rule set out in column 3 has to be applied.<br /> Note 3:<br /> 1. The provisions of Article 4 of this Protocol concerning products having acquired originating<br /> status which are used in the manufacture of other products apply regardless of whether this<br /> status has been acquired inside the factory where these products are used or in another factory in<br /> the UK or in Ghana.<br /> Example:<br /> An engine of heading 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-originating<br /> materials which may be incorporated may not exceed 40 per cent of the ex-works price, is made<br /> from \"other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging\" of heading ex 7224.<br /> If this forging has been forged in the UK from a non-originating ingot, it has already acquired<br /> originating status by virtue of the rule for heading ex 7224 in the list. The forging can then count<br /> as originating in the value calculation for the engine, regardless of whether it was produced in<br /> the same factory or in another factory in the UK. The value of the non-originating ingot is thus<br /> not taken into account when adding up the value of the non-originating materials used.<br /> 2. The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing required, and the<br /> carrying out of more working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the<br /> carrying out of less working or processing cannot confer originating status. Thus, if a rule<br /> provides that non-originating material, at a certain level of manufacture, may be used, the use of<br /> such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed, and the use of such material at a later<br /> stage is not.<br /> 3. Without prejudice to Note 3.2 where a rule states that \"materials of any heading\" may be used,<br /> materials of the same heading as the product may also be used, subject, however, to any specific<br /> limitations which may also be contained in the rule. However, the expression \"manufacture<br /> from materials of any heading, including other materials of heading ...\" means that only<br /> materials classified in the same heading as the product of a description other than that of the<br /> product as given in column 2 of the list may be used.<br /> 4. When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one<br /> material, this means that one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all be used.<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for fabrics of headings 5208 to 5212 provides that natural fibres may be used and that<br /> chemical materials, among other materials, may also be used. This does not mean that both have<br /> to be used; it is possible to use one or the other, or both.<br /> 5. Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular material,<br /> the condition does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their inherent nature,<br /> cannot satisfy the rule (see also Note 6.3 below in relation to textiles).<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for prepared foods of heading 1904, which specifically excludes the use of cereals and<br /> their derivatives, does not prevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and other additives which<br /> are not produced from cereals.<br /> However, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be manufactured from the<br /> particular materials specified in the list, can be produced from a material of the same nature at<br /> an earlier stage of manufacture.<br /> Example:<br /> In the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 of the Harmonized System made from non-<br /> woven materials, if the use of only non-originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is<br /> not possible to start from non-woven cloth - even if non-woven cloths cannot normally be made<br /> from yarn. In such cases, the starting material would normally be at the stage before yarn - that<br /> is, the fibre stage.<br /> 6. Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of non-originating<br /> materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be added together. In other words,<br /> the maximum value of all the non-originating materials used may never exceed the higher of the<br /> percentages given. Furthermore, the individual percentages must not be exceeded, in relation to<br /> the particular materials to which they apply.<br /> Note 4:<br /> 1. The term \"natural fibres\" is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic<br /> fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless<br /> otherwise specified, includes fibres which have been carded, combed or otherwise processed,<br /> but not spun.<br /> 2. The term \"natural fibres\" includes horsehair of heading 0511, silk of headings 5002 and 5003,<br /> as well as wool fibres and fine or coarse animal hair of headings 5101 to 5105, cotton fibres of<br /> headings 5201 to 5203, and other vegetable fibres of headings 5301 to 5305.<br /> 3. The terms \"textile pulp\", \"chemical materials\" and \"paper-making materials\" are used in the list<br /> to describe the materials, not classified in Chapters 50 to 63 of the Harmonized System, which<br /> can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.<br /> 4. The term \"man-made staple fibres\" is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament<br /> tow, staple fibres or waste, of headings 5501 to 5507.<br /> Note 5:<br /> 1. Where, for a given product in the list, reference is made to this Note, the conditions set out in<br /> column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials used in the manufacture of this<br /> product and which, taken together, represent 10 per cent or less of the total weight of all the<br /> basic textile materials used (see also Notes 5.3 and 5.4 below).<br /> 2. However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 5.1 may be applied only to mixed products which<br /> have been made from two or more basic textile materials.<br /> The following are the basic textile materials:<br /> \u2014 silk,<br /> \u2014 wool,<br /> \u2014 coarse animal hair,<br /> \u2014 fine animal hair,<br /> \u2014 horsehair,<br /> \u2014 cotton,<br /> \u2014 paper-making materials and paper,<br /> \u2014 flax,<br /> \u2014 true hemp,<br /> \u2014 jute and other textile bast fibres,<br /> \u2014 sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave,<br /> \u2014 coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made filaments,<br /> \u2014 artificial man-made filaments,<br /> \u2014 current-conducting filaments,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyphenylene sulphide,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyvinyl chloride,<br /> \u2014 other synthetic man-made staple fibres,<br /> \u2014 artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose,<br /> \u2014 other artificial man-made staple fibres,<br /> \u2014 yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not<br /> gimped,<br /> \u2014 yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester, whether or not<br /> gimped,<br /> \u2014 products of heading 5605 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core of<br /> aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of<br /> a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive<br /> between two layers of plastic film,<br /> \u2014 other products of heading 5605.<br /> Example:<br /> A yarn of heading 5205 made from cotton fibres of heading 5203 and synthetic staple fibres of<br /> heading 5506 is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres that do not<br /> satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) may<br /> be used up to a weight of 10 per cent of the yarn.<br /> Example:<br /> A woollen fabric of heading 5112 made from woollen yarn of heading 5107 and synthetic yarn<br /> of staple fibres of heading 5509 is a mixed fabric. Therefore, synthetic yarn which does not<br /> satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp), or<br /> woollen yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from natural<br /> fibres, not carded or combed or otherwise prepared for spinning) or a combination of the two<br /> may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10 per cent of the weight of the<br /> fabric.<br /> Example:<br /> Tufted textile fabric of heading 5802 made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and cotton fabric<br /> of heading 5210 is only a mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric made from<br /> yarns classified in two separate headings or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.<br /> Example:<br /> If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and<br /> synthetic fabric of heading 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic textile<br /> materials and the tufted textile fabric is, accordingly, a mixed product.<br /> 3. In the case of products incorporating \"yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible<br /> segments of polyether, whether or not gimped\" this tolerance is 20 per cent in respect of the<br /> yarn.<br /> 4. In the case of products incorporating a \"strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core<br /> of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm,<br /> sandwiched by means of an adhesive between two layers of plastic film\", this tolerance is 30 per<br /> cent in respect of this strip.<br /> Note 6:<br /> 1. In the case of those textile products which are marked in the list by a footnote referring to this<br /> Introductory Note, textile trimmings and accessories which do not satisfy the rule set out in the<br /> list in column 3 for the made-up products concerned may be used provided that their weight<br /> does not exceed 10 per cent of the total weight of all the textile materials incorporated.<br /> Textile trimmings and accessories are those classified in Chapters 50 to 63 of the Harmonized<br /> System. Linings and interlinings are not to be regarded as trimmings or accessories.<br /> 2. Any non-textile trimmings and accessories or other materials used which contain textiles do not<br /> have to satisfy the conditions set out in column 3 even though they fall outside the scope of<br /> Note 3.5.<br /> 3. In accordance with Note 3.5, any non-originating non-textile trimmings and accessories or other<br /> products which do not contain any textiles may, anyway, be used freely where they cannot be<br /> made from the materials listed in column 3.<br /> For example1, if a rule in the list says that for a particular textile item, such as a blouse, yarn<br /> must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because they cannot<br /> be made from textile materials.<br /> 1 This example is given for the purpose of explanation only. It is not legally binding.<br /> 4. Where a percentage rule applies, the value of trimmings and accessories must be taken into<br /> account when calculating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.<br /> Note 7:<br /> 1. For the purposes of headings ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex 3403, the<br /> \"specific processes\" are the following:<br /> (a) vacuum distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process2;<br /> (c) cracking;<br /> (d) reforming;<br /> (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f) the process comprising all the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric<br /> acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolourisation and<br /> purification with naturally active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;<br /> (g) polymerisation;<br /> (h) alkylation;<br /> (i) isomerisation.<br /> 2.

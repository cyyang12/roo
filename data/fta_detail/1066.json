The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column<br /> gives the heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonized System and the<br /> second column gives the description of goods used in that system for that heading or<br /> chapter. For each entry in the first two columns a rule is specified in columns 3 or 4<br /> and 5 or 6. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an \"ex\",<br /> this signifies that the rules in columns 3 or 4 and 5 or 6 apply only to the part of that<br /> heading as described in column 2.<br /> 2. Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter<br /> number is given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in<br /> general terms, the adjacent rules in columns 3 or 4 and 5 or 6 apply to all products<br /> which, under the Harmonized System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in<br /> any of the headings grouped together in column 1.<br /> 3. Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within<br /> a heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by<br /> the adjacent rules in columns 3 or 4 and 5 or 6.<br /> 4. Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns<br /> 3 or 4 and 5 or 6, the exporter may opt, as an alternative, to apply either the rule set<br /> out in column 3 or that set out in column 4 or the rule set out in column 5 or that set<br /> out in column 6. If no origin rule is given in column 4 or 6, the rule set out in column<br /> 3 or 5 has to be applied.<br /> Note 3:<br /> 1. The provisions of Article 8 of the Protocol concerning products having<br /> acquired originating status which are used in the manufacture of other products apply<br /> regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where these<br /> products are used or in another factory in the UK or in the EAC Partner State(s).<br /> 446<br /> Example:<br /> An engine of heading No 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the<br /> non-originating materials which may be incorporated may not exceed 40 per<br /> cent of the ex-works price, is made from \"other alloy steel roughly shaped by<br /> forging\" of heading No ex 7224.<br /> If this forging has been forged in the UK from a non-originating ingot, it has<br /> already acquired originating status by virtue of the rule for heading No ex 7224<br /> in the list. The forging can then count as originating in the value calculation<br /> for the engine regardless of whether it was produced in the same factory or in<br /> another factory in the UK. The value of the non-originating ingot is thus not<br /> taken into account when adding up the value of the non-originating materials<br /> used.<br /> 2. The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing<br /> required and the carrying out of more working or processing also confers originating<br /> status; conversely, the carrying out of less working or processing cannot confer<br /> originating status. Therefore, if a rule provides that non-originating material at a<br /> certain level of manufacture may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage<br /> of manufacture is allowed and the use of such material at a later stage is not.<br /> 3. Without prejudice to Note 3.2 where a rule states that \"materials of any<br /> heading\" may be used, materials of the same heading as the product may also be<br /> used, subject, however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in<br /> the rule. However, the expression \"manufacture from materials of any heading,<br /> including other materials of heading No ...\" means that only materials classified in<br /> the same heading as the product of a different description than that of the product as<br /> given in column 2 of the list may be used.<br /> 4. When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more<br /> than one material, this means that any one or more materials may be used. It does<br /> not require that all be used.<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for fabrics of heading Nos 5208 to 5212 provides that natural fibres<br /> may be used and that chemical materials, among other materials, may also be<br /> used. This does not mean that both have to be used; it is possible to use one or<br /> the other or both.<br /> 5. Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a<br /> particular material, the condition obviously does not prevent the use of other<br /> materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule. (See also<br /> Note 6.3 below in relation to textiles).<br /> 447<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for prepared foods of heading No 1904 which specifically excludes<br /> the use of cereals and their derivatives does not prevent the use of mineral salts,<br /> chemicals and other additives which are not products from cereals.<br /> However, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be<br /> manufactured from the particular materials specified in the list, can be<br /> produced from a material of the same nature at an earlier stage of manufacture.<br /> Example:<br /> In the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 made from non-woven<br /> materials, if the use of only non-originating yarn is allowed for this class of<br /> article, it is not possible to start from non-woven cloth - even if non-woven<br /> cloths cannot normally be made from yarn. In such cases, the starting material<br /> would normally be at the stage before yarn - that is the fibre stage.<br /> 6. Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value<br /> of non-originating materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be<br /> added together. In other words, the maximum value of all the non-originating<br /> materials used may never exceed the highest of the percentages given. Furthermore,<br /> the individual percentages must not be exceeded in relation to the particular materials<br /> they apply to.<br /> Note 4:<br /> 1. The term \"natural fibres\" is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial<br /> or synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including<br /> waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres that have been carded, combed<br /> or otherwise processed but not spun.<br /> 2. The term \"natural fibres\" includes horsehair of heading No 0503, silk of<br /> heading Nos 5002 and 5003 as well as the wool fibres, fine or coarse animal hair of<br /> heading Nos 5101 to 5105, the cotton fibres of heading Nos 5201 to 5203 and the<br /> other vegetable fibres of heading Nos 5301 to 5305.<br /> 3. The terms \"textile pulp\", \"chemical materials\" and \"paper-making materials\"<br /> are used in the list to describe the materials not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which<br /> can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.<br /> 4. The term \"man-made staple fibres\" is used in the list to refer to synthetic or<br /> artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of heading Nos 5501 to 5507.<br /> 448<br /> Note 5:<br /> 1. Where for a given product in the list a reference is made to this note, the<br /> conditions set out in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials, used<br /> in the manufacture of this product, which, taken together, represent 10 per cent or<br /> less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 5.3 and<br /> 5.4 below).<br /> 2. However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 5.1 may only be applied to mixed<br /> products which have been made from two or more basic textile materials.<br /> The following are the basic textile materials:<br /> - silk,<br /> - wool,<br /> - coarse animal hair,<br /> - fine animal hair,<br /> - horsehair,<br /> - cotton,<br /> - paper-making materials and paper,<br /> - flax,<br /> - true hemp,<br /> - jute and other textile bast fibres,<br /> - sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave,<br /> - coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,<br /> - synthetic man-made filaments,<br /> - artificial man-made filaments,<br /> - current conducting filaments,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide,<br /> 449<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyphenylene sulphide,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyvinyl chloride,<br /> - other synthetic man-made staple fibres,<br /> - artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose,<br /> - other artificial man-made staple fibres,<br /> - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of<br /> polyether whether or not gimped,<br /> - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of<br /> polyester whether or not gimped,<br /> - products of heading No 5605 (metallized yarn) incorporating strip<br /> consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film<br /> whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not<br /> exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or<br /> coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film,<br /> - other products of heading No 5605.<br /> Example:<br /> A yarn of heading No 5205 made from cotton fibres of heading No 5203 and<br /> synthetic staple fibres of heading No 5506 is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-<br /> originating synthetic staple fibres that do not satisfy the origin rules (which<br /> require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) may be used up<br /> to a weight of 10 per cent of the yarn.<br /> 450<br /> Example:<br /> A woollen fabric of heading No 5112 made from woollen yarn of heading No<br /> 5107 and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading No 5509 is a mixed fabric.<br /> Therefore synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules (which require<br /> manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) or woollen yarn that does<br /> not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from natural fibres, not<br /> carded or combed or otherwise prepared for spinning) or a combination of the<br /> two may be used provided their total weight does not exceed 10 per cent of the<br /> weight of the fabric.<br /> Example:<br /> Tufted textile fabric of heading No 5802 made from cotton yarn of heading No<br /> 5205 and cotton fabric of heading No 5210 is only a mixed product if the cotton<br /> fabric is itself a mixed fabric being made from yarns classified in two separate<br /> headings or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.<br /> Example:<br /> If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of<br /> heading No 5205 and synthetic fabric of heading No 5407, then, obviously, the<br /> yarns used are two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric<br /> is accordingly a mixed product.<br /> 3. In the case of products incorporating \"yarn made of polyurethane segmented<br /> with flexible segments of polyether whether or not gimped\" this tolerance is 20 per<br /> cent in respect of this yarn.<br /> 4. In the case of products incorporating \"strip consisting of a core of aluminium<br /> foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a<br /> width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of an adhesive between two layers<br /> of plastic film\", this tolerance is 30 per cent in respect of this strip.<br /> Note 6:<br /> 1. In the case of those textile products, which are marked in the list by a footnote<br /> referring to this Introductory Note, textile trimmings and accessories which do not<br /> satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the made up products concerned<br /> may be used provided that their weight does not exceed 10% of the total weight of<br /> all the textile materials incorporated.<br /> Textile trimmings and accessories are those classified in Chapters 50 to 63. Linings<br /> and interlinings are not be regarded as trimmings or accessories.<br /> 2. Any non-textile trimmings and accessories or other materials used which<br /> contain textiles do not have to satisfy the conditions set out in column 3 even though<br /> they fall outside the scope of Note 3.5.<br /> 451<br /> 3. In accordance with Note 3.5, any non-originating non-textile trimmings and<br /> accessories or other product, which do not contain any textiles, may, anyway, be<br /> used freely where they cannot be made from the materials listed in column 3.<br /> For example* 1, if a rule in the list says that for a particular textile item, such as a<br /> blouse, yarn must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as<br /> buttons, because they cannot be made from textile materials.<br /> 4. Where a percentage rule applies, the value of trimmings and accessories must<br /> be taken into account when calculating the value of the non-originating materials<br /> incorporated.<br /> Note 7:<br /> 1. For the purposes of heading Nos ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and<br /> ex 3403, the \"specific processes\" are the following:<br /> (a) vacuum distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process2;<br /> (c) cracking;<br /> (d) reforming;<br /> (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f) the process comprising all the following operations: processing with<br /> concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride;<br /> neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification with<br /> naturally active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;<br /> (g) polymerisation;<br /> (h) alkylation;<br /> (i) isomerisation.<br /> 2.

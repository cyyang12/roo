The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column gives the<br /> heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonised System and the second column<br /> gives the description of goods used in that system for that heading or chapter. For each entry<br /> in the first two columns, a rule is specified in column 3 or 4. Where, in some cases, the entry<br /> in the first column is preceded by an \"ex\", this signifies that the rules in column 3 or 4 apply<br /> only to the part of that heading as described in column 2.<br /> 2.2. Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number is<br /> given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the<br /> adjacent rules in column 3 or 4 apply to all products which, under the Harmonised System,<br /> are classified in headings of the chapter or in any of the headings grouped together in<br /> column 1.<br /> 2.3. Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each<br /> indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rules in<br /> column 3 or 4.<br /> 2.4. Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns 3 and 4, the<br /> exporter may opt to apply either the rule set out in column 3 or that set out in column 4. If no<br /> origin rule is given in column 4, the rule set out in column 3 is to be applied.<br /> Note 3:<br /> 3.1. The provisions of Article 5 of this Appendix, concerning products having acquired originating<br /> status which are used in the manufacture of other products, shall apply regardless of whether<br /> this status has been acquired inside the factory where these products are used or in another<br /> factory in a Contracting Party.<br /> Example:<br /> An engine of heading 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-originating<br /> materials which may be incorporated may not exceed 40 % of the ex-works price, is made<br /> from \"other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging\" of heading ex 7224.<br /> If this forging has been forged in the European Union from a non-originating ingot, it has<br /> already acquired originating status by virtue of the rule for heading ex 7224 in the list. The<br /> forging can then count as originating in the value-calculation for the engine, regardless of<br /> whether it was produced in the same factory or in another factory in the European Union. The<br /> value of the non-originating ingot is thus not taken into account when adding up the value of<br /> the non-originating materials used.<br /> 3.2. The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing required, and the<br /> carrying-out of more working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the<br /> carrying-out of less working or processing cannot confer originating status. Thus, if a rule<br /> provides that non-originating material, at a certain level of manufacture, may be used, the use<br /> of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed, and the use of such material at a<br /> later stage is not.<br /> 3.3. Without prejudice to Note 3.2, where a rule uses the expression \"Manufacture from materials<br /> of any heading\", then materials of any heading(s) (even materials of the same description and<br /> heading as the product) may be used, subject, however, to any specific limitations which may<br /> also be contained in the rule.<br /> However, the expression \"Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other<br /> materials of heading ...\" or \"Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other<br /> materials of the same heading as the product\" means that materials of any heading(s) may be<br /> used, except those of the same description as the product as given in column 2 of the list.<br /> 3.4. When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one<br /> material, this means that one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all<br /> be used.<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for fabrics of headings 5208 to 5212 provides that natural fibres may be used and<br /> that chemical materials, among other materials, may also be used. This does not mean that<br /> both have to be used; it is possible to use one or the other, or both.<br /> 3.5. Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular<br /> material, the condition does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their<br /> inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule. (See also Note 6.2 below in relation to textiles).<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for prepared foods of heading 1904, which specifically excludes the use of cereals<br /> and their derivatives, does not prevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and other additives<br /> which are not products from cereals.<br /> However, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be manufactured from<br /> the particular materials specified in the list, can be produced from a material of the same<br /> nature at an earlier stage of manufacture.<br /> Example:<br /> In the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 made from non-woven materials, if the<br /> use of only non-originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is not possible to start<br /> from non-woven cloth - even if non-woven cloths cannot normally be made from yarn. In<br /> such cases, the starting material would normally be at the stage before yarn - that is, the<br /> fibre stage.<br /> 3.6. Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of non-<br /> originating materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be added together. In<br /> other words, the maximum value of all the non-originating materials used may never exceed<br /> the higher of the percentages given. Furthermore, the individual percentages must not be<br /> exceeded, in relation to the particular materials to which they apply.<br /> Note 4:<br /> 4.1. The term \"natural fibres\" is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic<br /> fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless<br /> otherwise specified, includes fibres which have been carded, combed or otherwise processed,<br /> but not spun.<br /> 4.2. The term \"natural fibres\" includes horsehair of heading 0511, silk of headings 5002 and 5003,<br /> as well as wool fibres and fine or coarse animal hair of headings 5101 to 5105, cotton fibres<br /> of headings 5201 to 5203, and other vegetable fibres of headings 5301 to 5305.<br /> 4.3. The terms \"textile pulp\", \"chemical materials\" and \"paper-making materials\" are used in the<br /> list to describe the materials, not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to<br /> manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.<br /> 4.4. The term \"man-made staple fibres\" is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament<br /> tow, staple fibres or waste, of headings 5501 to 5507.<br /> Note 5:<br /> 5.1. Where, for a given product in the list, reference is made to this Note, the conditions set out in<br /> column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials used in the manufacture of this<br /> product and which, taken together, represent 10 % or less of the total weight of all the basic<br /> textile materials used. (See also Notes 5.3 and 5.4).<br /> 5.2. However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 5.1 may be applied only to mixed products which<br /> have been made from two or more basic textile materials.<br /> The following are the basic textile materials:<br /> - silk,<br /> - wool,<br /> - coarse animal hair,<br /> - fine animal hair,<br /> - horsehair,<br /> - cotton,<br /> - paper-making materials and paper,<br /> - flax,<br /> - true hemp,<br /> - jute and other textile bast fibres,<br /> - sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave,<br /> - coconut, abaca , ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,<br /> - synthetic man-made filaments,<br /> - artificial man-made filaments,<br /> - current-conducting filaments,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(phenylene sulphide),<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(vinyl chloride),<br /> - other synthetic man-made staple fibres,<br /> - artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose,<br /> - other artificial man-made staple fibres,<br /> - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or<br /> not gimped,<br /> - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester, whether or<br /> not gimped,<br /> - products of heading 5605 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core of<br /> aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium<br /> powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or<br /> coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film,<br /> - other products of heading 5605.<br /> Example:<br /> A yarn, of heading 5205, made from cotton fibres of heading 5203 and synthetic staple fibres<br /> of heading 5506, is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres which do<br /> not satisfy the origin-rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile<br /> pulp) may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10 % of the weight of<br /> the yarn.<br /> Example:<br /> A woollen fabric, of heading 5112, made from woollen yarn of heading 5107 and synthetic<br /> yarn of staple fibres of heading 5509, is a mixed fabric. Therefore, synthetic yarn which does<br /> not satisfy the origin-rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile<br /> pulp), or woollen yarn which does not satisfy the origin-rules (which require manufacture<br /> from natural fibres, not carded or combed or otherwise prepared for spinning), or a<br /> combination of the two, may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10 % of<br /> the weight of the fabric.<br /> Example:<br /> Tufted textile fabric, of heading 5802, made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and cotton<br /> fabric of heading 5210, is a only mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric<br /> made from yarns classified in two separate headings, or if the cotton yarns used are<br /> themselves mixtures.<br /> Example:<br /> If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and<br /> synthetic fabric of heading 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic textile<br /> materials and the tufted textile fabric is, accordingly, a mixed product.<br /> 5.3. In the case of products incorporating \"yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible<br /> segments of polyether, whether or not gimped\", this tolerance is 20 % in respect of this yarn.<br /> 5.4. In the case of products incorporating \"strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core<br /> of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm,<br /> sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic<br /> film\", this tolerance is 30 % in respect of this strip.<br /> Note 6:<br /> 6.1. Where, in the list, reference is made to this Note, textile materials (with the exception of<br /> linings and interlinings), which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the<br /> made-up product concerned, may be used, provided that they are classified in a heading other<br /> than that of the product and that their value does not exceed 8 % of the ex-works price of<br /> the product.<br /> 6.2. Without prejudice to Note 6.3, materials, which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63,<br /> may be used freely in the manufacture of textile products, whether or not they contain textiles.<br /> Example:<br /> If a rule in the list provides that, for a particular textile item (such as trousers), yarn must be<br /> used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because buttons are not<br /> classified within Chapters 50 to 63. For the same reason, it does not prevent the use of<br /> slide-fasteners, even though slide-fasteners normally contain textiles.<br /> 6.3. Where a percentage rule applies, the value of materials which are not classified within<br /> Chapters 50 to 63 must be taken into account when calculating the value of the<br /> non-originating materials incorporated.<br /> Note 7:<br /> 7.1. For the purposes of headings ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex 3403, the<br /> \"specific processes\" are the following:<br /> (a) vacuum-distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;<br /> (c) cracking;<br /> (d) reforming;<br /> (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f) the process comprising all of the following operations: processing with concentrated<br /> sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents;<br /> decolonisation and purification with naturally active earth, activated earth, activated<br /> charcoal or bauxite;<br /> (g) polymerisation;<br /> (h) alkylation;<br /> (i) isomerisation.<br /> 7.2. For the purposes of headings 2710, 2711 and 2712, the \"specific processes\" are the following:<br /> (a) vacuum-distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;<br /> (c) cracking;<br /> (d) reforming;<br /> (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f) the process comprising all of the following operations: processing with concentrated<br /> sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents;<br /> decolonisation and purification with naturally active earth, activated earth, activated<br /> charcoal or bauxite;<br /> (g) polymerisation;<br /> (h) alkylation;<br /> (i) isomerisation;<br /> (j) in respect of heavy oils of heading ex 2710 only, desulphurisation with hydrogen,<br /> resulting in a reduction of at least 85 % of the sulphur content of the products processed<br /> (ASTM D 1266-59 T method);<br /> (k) in respect of products of heading 2710 only, deparaffining by a process other<br /> than filtering;<br /> (l) in respect of heavy oils of heading ex 2710 only, treatment with hydrogen, at a pressure<br /> of more than 20 bar and a temperature of more than 250 \u00b0C, with the use of a catalyst,<br /> other than to effect desulphurisation, when the hydrogen constitutes an active element in<br /> a chemical reaction. The further treatment, with hydrogen, of lubricating oils of<br /> heading ex 2710 (e.g. hydrofinishing or decolourisation), in order, more especially, to<br /> improve colour or stability shall not, however, be deemed to be a specific process;<br /> (m) in respect of fuel oils of heading ex 2710 only, atmospheric distillation, on condition<br /> that less than 30 % of these products distils, by volume, including losses, at 300 \u00b0C, by<br /> the ASTM D 86 method;<br /> (n) in respect of heavy oils other than gas oils and fuel oils of heading ex 2710 only,<br /> treatment by means of a high-frequency electrical brush discharge;<br /> (o) in respect of crude products (other than petroleum jelly, ozokerite, lignite wax or peat<br /> wax, paraffin wax containing by weight less than 0.75 % of oil) of heading ex 2712<br /> only, de-oiling by fractional crystallisation.<br /> 7.3.

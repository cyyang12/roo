The first<br /> column gives the subheading number, heading number or chapter<br /> number used in the Harmonized System and the second column gives<br /> the description of goods used in that system for that subheading,<br /> heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns, a rule is<br /> specified in column 3. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first<br /> column is preceded by an 'ex', this signifies that the rules in column 3<br /> apply only to the part of that subheading or heading as described in<br /> column 2.<br /> 2.2 Where several subheading or heading numbers are grouped together in<br /> column 1 or a chapter number is given and the description of products in<br /> column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rules in<br /> column 3 apply to all products which, under the Harmonized System, are<br /> classified in subheadings or headings of the chapter or in any of the<br /> subheadings or headings grouped together in column 1.<br /> 2.3 Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products<br /> within a subheading or heading, each indent contains the description of<br /> that part of the subheading or heading covered by the adjacent rules in<br /> column 3.<br /> Note 3:<br /> 3.1 The provisions of Article 4.5 (Sufficiently Worked or Processed Products)<br /> of Chapter 4 (Rules of Origin), concerning products having acquired<br /> originating status which are used in the manufacture of other products,<br /> shall apply, regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside<br /> the factory where these products are used or in another factory in Turkey<br /> or in Malaysia.<br /> Example:<br /> An engine of heading 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the<br /> non-originating materials which may be incorporated may not exceed<br /> 50% of the ex-works price, is made from \"other alloy steel roughly<br /> shaped by forging\" of heading ex 7224.<br /> If this forging has been forged in Turkey from a non-originating ingot, it<br /> has already acquired originating status by virtue of the rule for heading<br /> ex 7224 in the list. The forging can then count as originating in the<br /> value-calculation for the engine, regardless of whether it was produced in<br /> the same factory or in another factory in Turkey concerned. The value of<br /> the non-originating ingot is thus not taken into account when adding up<br /> the value of the non-originating materials used.<br /> 3.2 The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or<br /> processing required, and the carrying-out of more working or processing<br /> also confers originating status; conversely, the carrying-out of less<br /> working or processing cannot confer originating status. Thus, if a rule<br /> provides that non-originating material, at a certain level of manufacture,<br /> may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture<br /> is allowed, and the use of such material at a later stage is not.<br /> 3.3 Without prejudice to Note 3.2, where a rule uses the expression<br /> \"Manufacture from materials of any heading\", then materials of any<br /> heading(s) (even materials of the same description and heading as the<br /> product) may be used, subject, however, to any specific limitations which<br /> may also be contained in the rule.<br /> However, the expression \"Manufacture from materials of any heading,<br /> including other materials of heading ...\" or \"Manufacture from materials<br /> of any heading, including other materials of the same heading as the<br /> product\" means that materials of any heading(s) may be used, except<br /> those of the same description as the product as given in column 2 of the<br /> list.<br /> 3.4 When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured<br /> from more than one material, this means that one or more materials may<br /> be used. It does not require that all be used.<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for fabrics of headings 5208 to 5212 provides that natural fibres<br /> may be used and that chemical materials, among other materials, may<br /> also be used. This does not mean that both have to be used; it is<br /> possible to use one or the other, or both.<br /> 3.5 Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured<br /> from a particular material, the condition obviously does not prevent the<br /> use of other materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot<br /> satisfy the rule. (See also Note 7.2 below in relation to textiles).<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for prepared foods of heading 1904, which specifically excludes<br /> the use of cereals and their derivatives, does not prevent the use of<br /> mineral salts, chemicals and other additives which are not products from<br /> cereals.<br /> However, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be<br /> manufactured from the particular materials specified in the list, can be<br /> produced from a material of the same nature at an earlier stage of<br /> manufacture.<br /> Example:<br /> In the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 made from non-<br /> woven materials, if the use of only non-originating yarn is allowed for this<br /> class of article, it is not possible to start from non-woven cloth - even if<br /> non-woven cloths cannot normally be made from yarn. In such cases,<br /> the starting material would normally be at the stage before yarn - that is,<br /> the fibre stage.<br /> 3.6 Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum<br /> value of non-originating materials that can be used, then these<br /> percentages may not be added together. In other words, the maximum<br /> value of all the non-originating materials used may never exceed the<br /> higher of the percentages given. Furthermore, the individual percentages<br /> must not be exceeded, in relation to the particular materials to which<br /> they apply.<br /> Note 4:<br /> 4.1. Agricultural goods falling within Chapters 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and heading<br /> 2401 which are grown or harvested in the territory of a beneficiary<br /> country shall be treated as originating in the territory of that country, even<br /> if grown from seeds, bulbs, rootstock, cuttings, grafts, shoots, buds, or<br /> other live parts of plants imported from another country.<br /> 4.2. In cases where the content of non originating sugar in a given product is<br /> subject to limitations, the weight of sugars of headings 1701 (sucrose)<br /> and 1702 (e.g., fructose, glucose, lactose, maltose, isoglucose or invert<br /> sugar) used in the manufacture of the final product and used in the<br /> manufacture of the non-originating products incorporated in the final<br /> product is taken into account for the calculation of such limitations.<br /> Note 5:<br /> 5.1 The term \"natural fibres\" is used in the list to refer to fibres other than<br /> artificial or synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning<br /> takes place, including waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes<br /> fibres that have been carded, combed or otherwise processed but not<br /> spun.<br /> 5.2 The term \"natural fibres\" includes horsehair of heading 0503, silk of<br /> headings 5002 and 5003 as well as the wool-fibres and fine or coarse<br /> animal hair of headings 5101 to 5105, the cotton fibres of headings 5201<br /> to 5203, and the other vegetable fibres of headings 5301 to 5305.<br /> 5.3 The terms \"textile pulp\", \"chemical materials\" and \"paper-making<br /> materials\" are used in the list to describe the materials, not classified in<br /> Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic<br /> or paper fibres or yarns.<br /> 5.4 The term \"man-made staple fibres\" is used in the list to refer to synthetic<br /> or artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of headings 5501 to 5507.<br /> Note 6:<br /> 6.1 Where, for a given product in the list, a reference is made to this Note,<br /> the conditions set out in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile<br /> materials used in the manufacture of this product and which, taken<br /> together, represent 10% or less of the total weight of all the basic textile<br /> materials used. (See also Notes 6.3 and 6.4 below).<br /> 6.2 However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 6.1 may be applied only to<br /> mixed products which have been made from two or more basic textile<br /> materials.<br /> The following are the basic textile materials:<br /> - silk,<br /> - wool,<br /> - coarse animal hair,<br /> - fine animal hair,<br /> - horsehair,<br /> - cotton,<br /> - paper-making materials and paper,<br /> - flax,<br /> - true hemp,<br /> - jute and other textile bast fibres,<br /> - sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave,<br /> - coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,<br /> - synthetic man-made filaments,<br /> - artificial man-made filaments,<br /> - current-conducting filaments,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(phenylene sulphide),<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(vinyl chloride),<br /> - other synthetic man-made staple fibres,<br /> - artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose,<br /> - other artificial man-made staple fibres,<br /> - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of<br /> polyether, whether or not gimped,<br /> - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of<br /> polyester, whether or not gimped,<br /> - products of heading 5605 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip consisting<br /> of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not<br /> coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm,<br /> sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between<br /> two layers of plastic film,<br /> - other products of heading 5605.<br /> Example:<br /> A yarn, of heading 5205, made from cotton fibres of heading 5203 and<br /> synthetic staple fibres of heading 5506, is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-<br /> originating synthetic staple fibres which do not satisfy the origin-rules<br /> (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) may<br /> be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10% of the<br /> weight of the yarn.<br /> Example:<br /> A woollen fabric, of heading 5112, made from woollen yarn of heading<br /> 5107 and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading 5509, is a mixed<br /> fabric. Therefore, synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules<br /> (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp), or<br /> woollen yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules (which require<br /> manufacture from natural fibres, not carded or combed or otherwise<br /> prepared for spinning), or a combination of the two, may be used,<br /> provided their total weight does not exceed 10% of the weight of the<br /> fabric.<br /> Example:<br /> Tufted textile fabric, of heading 5802, made from cotton yarn of heading<br /> 5205 and cotton fabric of heading 5210, is only mixed product if the<br /> cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric made from yarns classified in two<br /> separate headings, or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.<br /> Example:<br /> If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of<br /> heading 5205 and synthetic fabric of heading 5407, then, obviously, the<br /> yarns used are two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile<br /> fabric is, accordingly, a mixed product.<br /> 6.3 In the case of products incorporating \"yarn made of polyurethane<br /> segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped\",<br /> this tolerance is 20% in respect of this yarn.<br /> 6.4 In the case of products incorporating \"strip consisting of a core of<br /> aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with<br /> aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by<br /> means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of<br /> plastic film\", this tolerance is 30% in respect of this strip.<br /> Note 7:<br /> 7.1 Where, in the list, reference is made to this Note, textile materials (with<br /> the exception of linings and interlinings), which do not satisfy the rule set<br /> out in the list in column 3 for the made-up product concerned, may be<br /> used, provided that they are classified in a heading other than that of the<br /> product and that their value does not exceed 8% of the ex-works price of<br /> the product.<br /> 7.2 Without prejudice to Note 7.3, materials, which are not classified within<br /> Chapters 50 to 63, may be used freely in the manufacture of textile<br /> products, whether or not they contain textiles.<br /> Example:<br /> If a rule in the list provides that, for a particular textile item (such as<br /> trousers), yarn must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal<br /> items, such as buttons, because buttons are not classified within<br /> Chapters 50 to 63. For the same reason, it does not prevent the use of<br /> slide-fasteners, even though slide-fasteners normally contain textiles.<br /> 7.3 Where a percentage-rule applies, the value of materials which are not<br /> classified within Chapters 50 to 63 must be taken into account when<br /> calculating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.<br /> Note 8<br /> 8.1 For the purposes of headings ex 2707 and 2713, the \"specific<br /> processes\" are the following:<br /> (a) vacuum distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;<br /> (c) cracking;<br /> (d) reforming;<br /> (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f) the process comprising all of the following operations: processing<br /> with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride;<br /> neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolorisation and purification<br /> with naturally active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or<br /> bauxite;<br /> (g) polymerisation;<br /> (h) alkylation;<br /> (i) isomerisation.<br /> 8.2 For the purposes of headings 2710, 2711 and 2712, the \"specific<br /> processes\" are the following:<br /> (a) vacuum distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;<br /> (c) cracking;<br /> (d) reforming;<br /> (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f) the process comprising all the following operations: processing<br /> with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride;<br /> neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolorisation and purification<br /> with naturally-active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or<br /> bauxite;<br /> (g) polymerisation;", "ShowProductAffected": false, "ProductAffected": null, "RevisionName": null, "Rank": 0, "ShowRooExceptions": false, "RooExceptions": null}], "SpecificNote": [{"RooCode": null, "RooText": null, "ShowProductAffected": false, "ProductAffected": null, "RevisionName": null, "Rank": 0, "ShowRooExceptions": false, "RooExceptions": null}], "Documents": [{"DocDesc": "Certificate of origin", "DocFileName": "itc00481_coo.pdf", "DocType": "1_coo", "WebLink": null}, {"DocDesc": "Product-specific rules of origin", "DocFileName": "itc00481_sroo.pdf", "DocType": "2_sroo", "WebLink": "http://fta.miti.gov.my/miti-fta/resources/Malaysia%20-%20Turkey/list_of_working_or_processing_required_to_be_carried_out_on_nonoriginating_materials.pdf"}, {"DocDesc": "Chapter on rules of origin", "DocFileName": "itc00481_roo.pdf", "DocType": "3_roo", "WebLink": "http://fta.miti.gov.my/miti-fta/resources/Malaysia%20-%20Turkey/Rules_of_Origin_Chapter_in_MTFTA.pdf"}, {"DocDesc": "Customs administration", "DocFileName": "itc00481_cusa.pdf", "DocType": "5_cusa", "WebLink": null}, {"DocDesc": "Full text of agreement", "DocFileName": "itc00481_full.pdf", "DocType": "8_full", "WebLink": "http://fta.miti.gov.my/miti-fta/resources/Malaysia%20-%20Turkey/MTFTA_Main_Agreement.pdf"}, {"DocDesc": "WTO notification", "DocFileName": "itc00481_wto.pdf", "DocType": "9_wto", "WebLink": "https://docs.wto.org/dol2fe/Pages/SS/directdoc.aspx?filename=q:/G/RO/N156.pdf"}]}, "FtaProvisions": {"RooProvision": [{"ProvisionAbbrev": "accum", "ProvisionCode": "Cumulation", "ProvisionValue": "cross-cumulation", "ProvisionRank": null, "ProvisionGlossary": "A provision which allows to consider goods obtained in as well as processing taking place in one FTA member country as originating in another.", "ProvisionGlossaryLink": "/en/glossary?uid=accum&returnto=gloscenter", "ProvisionLegalExtract": "Article 4.3 : Cumulation of Origin <br /> 1 Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 4.2 (Originating Products), <br /> materials originating in a Party shall be considered as materials originating in the <br /> other Party when incorporated into a product there.

For <br /> purposes of \u00a710.195, the words ''mate- <br /> rials produced in a beneficiary country <br /> or countries'' refer to those materials <br /> incorporated in an article which are ei- <br /> ther: <br /> (1) Wholly the growth, product, or <br /> manufacture of a beneficiary country <br /> or two or more beneficiary countries; <br /> or <br /> (2) Subject to the limitations set <br /> forth in \u00a710.195(a), substantially trans- <br /> formed in any beneficiary country or <br /> two or more beneficiary countries into <br /> a new or different article of commerce <br /> which is then used in any beneficiary <br /> country in the production or manufac- <br /> ture of a new or different article which <br /> is imported directly into the U.S. <br /> Example 1. A raw, perishable skin of an ani- <br /> mal grown in one beneficiary country is sent <br /> to another beneficiary country where it is <br /> tanned to create nonperishable ''crust leath- <br /> er''. The tanned product is then imported di- <br /> rectly into the U.S. Because the material of <br /> which the imported article is composed is <br /> wholly the growth, product, or manufacture <br /> of one of more beneficiary countries, the en- <br /> tire cost or value of that material may be <br /> counted toward the 35 percent value require- <br /> ment set forth in \u00a710.195. <br /> Example 2. A raw, perishable skin of an ani- <br /> mal grown in a non-beneficiary country is <br /> sent to a beneficiary country where it is <br /> tanned to create nonperishable ''crust leath- <br /> er''. The tanned skin is then imported di- <br /> rectly into the U.S. Although the tanned <br /> skin represents a new or different article of <br /> commerce produced in a beneficiary country <br /> within the meaning of \u00a710.195(a), the cost or <br /> value of the raw skin may not be counted to- <br /> ward the 35 percent value requirement be- <br /> cause (1) the tanned material of which the <br /> imported article is composed is not wholly <br /> the growth, product, or manufacture of a <br /> beneficiary country and (2) the tanning oper- <br /> ation creates the imported article itself <br /> rather than an intermediate article which is <br /> then used in the beneficiary country in the <br /> production or manufacture of an article im- <br /> ported into the U.S. The tanned skin would <br /> be eligible for duty-free treatment only if <br /> the direct costs attributable to the tanning <br /> operation represent at least 35 percent of the <br /> appraised value of the imported article. <br /> Example 3. A raw, perishable skin of an ani- <br /> mal grown in a non-beneficiary country is <br /> sent to a beneficiary country where it is <br /> tanned to create nonperishable ''crust leath- <br /> er''. The tanned material is then cut, sewn <br /> and assembled with a metal buckle imported <br /> from a non-beneficiary country to create a <br /> finished belt which is imported directly into <br /> the U.S. Because the operations performed in <br /> the beneficiary country involved both the <br /> substantial transformation of the raw skin <br /> into a new or different article and the use of <br /> that intermediate article in the production <br /> or manufacture of a new or different article <br /> imported into the U.S., the cost or value of <br /> the tanned material used to make the im- <br /> ported article may be counted toward the 35 <br /> percent value requirement. The cost or value <br /> of the metal buckle imported into the bene- <br /> ficiary country may not be counted toward <br /> the 35 percent value requirement because the <br /> buckle was not substantially transformed in <br /> the beneficiary country into a new or dif- <br /> ferent article prior to its incorporation in <br /> the finished belt. <br /> Example 4. A raw, perishable skin of an ani- <br /> mal grown in the U.S. Virgin Islands is sent <br /> to a beneficiary country where it is tanned <br /> to create nonperishable ''crust leather'', <br /> which is then imported directly into the U.S. <br /> The tanned skin represents a new or dif- <br /> ferent article of commerce produced in a <br /> beneficiary country within the meaning of <br /> \u00a710.195(a), and under \u00a710.195(b), the raw skin <br /> from which the tanned product was made is <br /> considered to have been grown in a bene- <br /> ficiary country for the purpose of applying <br /> \u00a710.197 <br /> the 35 percent value requirement. The <br /> tanned material of which the imported arti- <br /> cle is composed is considered to be wholly <br /> the growth, product, or manufacture of one <br /> or more beneficiary countries with the result <br /> that the entire cost or value of that material <br /> may be counted toward the 35 percent value <br /> requirement. <br /> (b) Questionable origin. When the ori- <br /> gin of a material either is not ascer- <br /> tainable or is not satisfactorily dem- <br /> onstrated to the Center director, the <br /> material shall not be considered to <br /> have been grown, produced, or manu- <br /> factured in a beneficiary country. <br /> (c) Determination of cost or value of <br /> materials produced in a beneficiary coun- <br /> try. (1) The cost or value of materials <br /> produced in a beneficiary country or <br /> countries includes: <br /> (1) The manufacturer's actual cost for <br /> the materials; <br /> (ii) When not included in the manu- <br /> facturer's actual cost for the materials, <br /> the freight, insurance, packing, and all <br /> other costs incurred in transporting <br /> the materials to the manufacturer's <br /> plant; <br /> (iii) The actual cost of waste or spoil- <br /> age (material list), less the value of re- <br /> coverable scrap; and <br /> (iv) Taxes and/or duties imposed on <br /> the materials by any beneficiary coun- <br /> try, provided they are not remitted <br /> upon exportation. <br /> (2) Where a material is provided to <br /> the manufacturer without charge, or at <br /> less than fair market value, its cost or <br /> value shall be determined by com- <br /> puting the sum of: <br /> (i) All expenses incurred in the <br /> growth, production, or manufacture of <br /> the material, including general ex- <br /> penses; <br /> (ii) An amount for profit; and <br /> (iii) Freight, insurance, packing, and <br /> all other costs incurred in transporting <br /> the material to the manufacturer's <br /> plant. <br /> If the pertinent information needed to <br /> compute the cost or value of a material <br /> is not available, the appraising officer <br /> may ascertain or estimate the value <br /> thereof using all reasonable ways and <br /> means at his disposal. <br /> [Code of Foreign Regulations Subpart O]: <br /> \u00a7 10.844 Value-content requirement. <br /> (a) Certain apparel articles-(1) Gen- <br /> eral. Except as provided in paragraph <br /> (a)(2) of this section, apparel articles <br /> described in \u00a7 10.843(a) of this subpart <br /> will be eligible for duty-free treatment <br /> only if, for each entry of such articles <br /> in the applicable one-year period for <br /> which a duty-free claim is made for <br /> such articles under \u00a7 10.847(a) of this <br /> subpart, the sum of the cost or value of <br /> the materials produced in Haiti or one <br /> or more eligible countries described in <br /> paragraph (c) of this section, or any <br /> combination thereof, plus the direct <br /> costs of processing operations per- <br /> formed in Haiti or one or more eligible <br /> countries described in paragraph (c) of <br /> this section, or any combination there- <br /> of, is not less than (as applicable): <br /> (1) 50 percent or more of the declared <br /> customs value of the articles entered <br /> during the initial applicable one-year <br /> period, the second applicable one-year <br /> period, and the third applicable one- <br /> year period; <br /> (ii) 55 percent or more of the declared <br /> customs value of the articles entered <br /> during the fourth applicable one-year <br /> period; and <br /> (iii) 60 percent or more of the de- <br /> clared customs value of the articles en- <br /> tered during the fifth applicable one- <br /> year period. <br /> (2) Annual aggregation-(i) Initial ap- <br /> plicable one-year period. In the initial <br /> applicable one-year period, the applica- <br /> ble value-content requirement set forth <br /> in paragraph (a)(1) of this section may <br /> also be met for apparel articles of a <br /> producer or an entity controlling pro- <br /> duction that are entered during the ini- <br /> tial applicable one-year period and for <br /> which duty-free treatment is claimed <br /> under \u00a7 10.847(a) of this subpart by ag- <br /> gregating the cost or value of mate- <br /> rials and the direct costs of processing <br /> operations, as those terms are used in <br /> paragraph (a)(1) of this section, with <br /> respect to all apparel articles of that <br /> producer or entity controlling produc- <br /> tion that are wholly assembled or knit- <br /> to-shape in Haiti and are entered dur- <br /> ing the initial applicable one-year pe- <br /> riod (except as provided in paragraph <br /> (a)(2)(iii) of this section). <br /> (ii) Other applicable one-year periods. <br /> In each of the second, third, fourth, <br /> and fifth applicable one-year periods, <br /> the applicable value-content require- <br /> ment set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of <br /> this section may also be met for ap- <br /> parel articles of a producer or an entity <br /> controlling production that are entered <br /> during the applicable one-year period <br /> and for which duty-free treatment is <br /> claimed under \u00a7 10.847(a) of this subpart <br /> by aggregating the cost or value of ma- <br /> terials and the direct costs of proc- <br /> essing, as those terms are used in para- <br /> graph (a)(1) of this section, with re- <br /> spect to all apparel articles of that pro- <br /> ducer or entity controlling production <br /> that are wholly assembled or knit-to- <br /> shape in Haiti and are entered during <br /> the preceding applicable one-year pe- <br /> riod (except as provided in paragraph <br /> (a)(2)(iii) of this section). <br /> (iii) Exclusions from annual aggrega- <br /> tion calculation. The entry of an apparel <br /> article that is wholly assembled or <br /> knit-to-shape in Haiti and is receiving <br /> preferential tariff treatment under any <br /> provision of law other than section <br /> 213A(b)(1) of the CBERA (19 U.S.C. <br /> 2703A(b)(1)) or is subject to the @^@Gen- <br /> eral@^@ subcolumn of column 1 of the <br /> HTSUS will only be included in an an- <br /> nual aggregation under paragraph <br /> (a)(2)(i) or (a)(2)(ii) of this section if the <br /> producer or entity controlling produc- <br /> tion elects, at the time the annual ag- <br /> gregation calculation is made, to in- <br /> clude such entry in the aggregation. <br /> Example. A Haitian producer elects to use <br /> the annual aggregation method in the initial <br /> applicable one-year period, and also elects to <br /> include in the aggregation calculation an <br /> entry of apparel articles receiving pref- <br /> erential tariff treatment under another pref- <br /> erence program. The producer ships to the <br /> United States four shipments during the ini- <br /> tial applicable one-year period and all are <br /> entered during that period. The first ship- <br /> ment of apparel (qualifying for and receiving <br /> preference under the Caribbean Basin Trade <br /> Partnership Act (CBTPA)) has an appraised <br /> value of $100,000 and meets a value-content <br /> percentage (under \u00a7 10.844(a) of this section) <br /> of 80%. The second shipment of apparel is <br /> wholly assembled in Haiti, has an appraised <br /> value of $100,000, and meets a value-content <br /> percentage of 40%. The third shipment is <br /> wholly assembled in Haiti, has an appraised <br /> value of $50,000, and meets a value-content <br /> percentage of 0%. The last shipment is whol- <br /> ly assembled in Haiti, has an appraised value <br /> of $20,000, and meets a value-content require- <br /> ment of 80%. Taken together, the four ship- <br /> ments have an appraised value of $270,000 and <br /> meet a value-content percentage of 50.4%. <br /> The apparel articles shipped to the United <br /> States in the last three shipments would <br /> qualify for duty-free treatment under section <br /> 213A(b)(1) of the CBERA and \u00a7 10.843(a) of this <br /> subpart as the applicable value-content re- <br /> quirement for the initial applicable one-year <br /> period (50 %) is satisfied. This conclusion as- <br /> sumes that: The CBTPA-eligible apparel ar- <br /> ticles in the first shipment (that were in- <br /> cluded in the annual aggregation calculation <br /> at the election of the producer) were wholly <br /> assembled or knit-to-shape in Haiti, as re- <br /> quired in \u00a7 10.844(a)(2)(iii) of this section; and <br /> the articles in the last three shipments that <br /> were wholly assembled in Haiti satisfy all <br /> other applicable requirements set forth in <br /> this subpart. <br /> (3) Election to use the annual aggrega- <br /> tion method for an applicable one-year <br /> period. A producer or entity controlling <br /> production may elect to use the indi- <br /> vidual entry or annual aggregation <br /> method in any applicable one-year pe- <br /> riod and then elect to use the other <br /> method during the subsequent applica- <br /> ble one-year period, provided that all <br /> applicable requirements are met during <br /> the applicable one-year period pre- <br /> ceding the period in which the switch <br /> is made. If a producer or entity con- <br /> trolling production using the indi- <br /> vidual entry method in an applicable <br /> one-year period elects to use the an- <br /> nual aggregation method during the <br /> subsequent applicable one-year period, <br /> the declaration of compliance de- <br /> scribed in \u00a710.848 of this subpart must <br /> be submitted to CBP within 30 days fol- <br /> lowing the end of the applicable one- <br /> year period in which the individual <br /> entry method was used. <br /> (4) Failure to meet applicable require- <br /> ments-(i) Initial applicable one-year pe- <br /> riod. Except as provided in paragraph <br /> (a)(4)(iii) of this section, if CBP deter- <br /> mines that apparel articles of a pro- <br /> ducer or entity controlling production <br /> that are entered as articles described <br /> in \u00a7 10.843(a) of this subpart during the <br /> initial applicable one-year period have <br /> not met the requirements of \u00a7 10.843(a) <br /> of this subpart or the applicable value- <br /> content requirement set forth in para- <br /> graph (a)(1) of this section, then: <br /> (A) All apparel articles of the pro- <br /> ducer or entity controlling production <br /> for which duty-free treatment is <br /> claimed under \u00a7 10.847(a) of this subpart <br /> that are entered under the annual ag- <br /> gregation method during that initial <br /> applicable one-year period will be de- <br /> nied duty-free treatment; <br /> (B) Those apparel articles of the pro- <br /> ducer or entity controlling production <br /> for which duty-free treatment is <br /> claimed under \u00a7 10.847(a) of this subpart <br /> that are entered on an individual entry <br /> basis and that fail to meet the require- <br /> ments of \u00a7 10.843(a)(1) of this subpart or <br /> the applicable value-content require- <br /> ment set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of <br /> this section during that initial applica- <br /> ble one-year period will be denied duty- <br /> free treatment. However, apparel arti- <br /> cles of the producer or entity control- <br /> ling production for which duty-free <br /> treatment is claimed under \u00a7 10.847(a) of <br /> this subpart that are entered on an in- <br /> dividual entry basis prior to an elec- <br /> tion being made by the producer or en- <br /> tity controlling production to use the <br /> annual aggregation method will be con- <br /> sidered to have met the applicable <br /> value-content requirement if that re- <br /> quirement is met through application <br /> of the individual entry method; and <br /> (C) All apparel articles of the pro- <br /> ducer or entity controlling production <br /> for which duty-free treatment is <br /> claimed under \u00a7 10.847(a) of this sub- <br /> part, whether entered on an individual <br /> entry or annual aggregation basis, will <br /> be not be eligible for duty-free treat- <br /> ment during the succeeding applicable <br /> one-year periods until the increased <br /> percentage in the value-content re- <br /> quirement specified in paragraph <br /> (a)(4)(iii) of this section has been met <br /> by all the apparel articles of that pro- <br /> ducer or entity controlling production <br /> that are wholly assembled or knit-to- <br /> shape in Haiti and are entered during <br /> the immediately preceding applicable <br /> one-year period, unless the articles <br /> qualify for tariff benefits pursuant to <br /> the provisions of \u00a710.845 of this sub- <br /> part. <br /> (ii) Other applicable one-year periods. <br /> Except as provided in paragraph <br /> (a)(4)(iii) of this section, if CBP deter- <br /> mines that apparel articles of a pro- <br /> ducer or entity controlling production <br /> that are entered as articles described <br /> in \u00a7 10.843(a) of this subpart during any <br /> applicable one-year period following <br /> the initial applicable one-year period <br /> have not met the requirements of <br /> \u00a7 10.843(a) or the applicable value-con- <br /> tent requirement set forth in para- <br /> graph (a) of this section, then: <br /> (A) Those apparel articles of the pro- <br /> ducer or entity controlling production <br /> for which duty-free treatment is <br /> claimed under \u00a7 10.847(a) of this subpart <br /> that are entered on an individual entry <br /> basis and that fail to meet the require- <br /> ments of \u00a7 10.843(a)(1) or the applicable <br /> value-content requirement set forth in <br /> paragraph (a)(1) of this subpart during <br /> that applicable one-year period will be <br /> denied duty-free treatment; and <br /> (B) All apparel articles of the pro- <br /> ducer or entity controlling production <br /> for which duty-free treatment is <br /> claimed under \u00a7 10.847(a) of this sub- <br /> part, whether entered on an individual <br /> entry or annual aggregation basis, will <br /> not be eligible for duty-free treatment <br /> during the succeeding applicable one- <br /> year periods until the increased per- <br /> centage in the value-content require- <br /> ment specified in paragraph (a)(4)(iii) <br /> of this section has been met by all the <br /> apparel articles of that producer or en- <br /> tity controlling production that are <br /> wholly assembled or knit-to-shape in <br /> Haiti and are entered during the imme- <br /> diately preceding applicable one-year <br /> period, unless the articles qualify for <br /> tariff benefits pursuant to the provi- <br /> sions of \u00a710.845 of this subpart. <br /> (iii) Entity controlling production of <br /> apparel articles of a producer also pro- <br /> ducing for its own account. Where an en- <br /> tity controlling production controls <br /> the production of apparel articles, as <br /> described in \u00a7 10.843(a) of this subpart, <br /> of a producer that also produces for its <br /> own account, the failure of apparel ar- <br /> ticles of that producer to meet the re- <br /> quirements of \u00a7 10.843(a) of this subpart <br /> or the applicable value-content re- <br /> quirement set forth in paragraph (a) of <br /> this section in an applicable one-year <br /> period, either under the annual aggre- <br /> gation method or the individual entry <br /> method, will not affect the eligibility <br /> for duty-free treatment under \u00a7 10.843(a) <br /> of this subpart of those apparel articles <br /> of that producer which are part of a <br /> claim for such treatment made on be- <br /> half of the entity controlling produc- <br /> tion. <br /> Example. Importer D, an entity controlling <br /> production, purchases apparel articles that <br /> meet the description in \u00a7 10.843(a) of this sub- <br /> part from Haitian Producers A, B, and C and <br /> enters those articles during the initial appli- <br /> cable one-year period. Importer D elects to <br /> use the annual aggregation method during <br /> that period. The three producers also <br /> produce apparel for other U.S. importers and <br /> each producer elects to use the annual aggre- <br /> gation method. The apparel articles pur- <br /> chased by Importer D from the three pro- <br /> ducers and entered during the initial appli- <br /> cable one-year period meet a value-content <br /> percentage of 51.7%. However, the value-con- <br /> tent percentage met by all the apparel that <br /> is wholly assembled in Haiti by Producer C <br /> and entered (including the apparel imported <br /> by Importer D) during the initial applicable <br /> one-year period is 49%. As all of the articles, <br /> in the aggregate, purchased by Importer D <br /> from the three producers and entered during <br /> the initial applicable one-year period satisfy <br /> the applicable value-content requirement <br /> (50%), all of these articles are entitled to <br /> duty-free treatment under section 213A(b)(1) <br /> of the CBERA and \u00a7 10.843(a) of this subpart, <br /> assuming all other applicable requirements <br /> are met. The failure of Producer C to meet <br /> the 50% value-content requirement with re- <br /> spect to all of the articles that it wholly as- <br /> sembled in Haiti and entered during the ini- <br /> tial applicable one-year period will not pre- <br /> vent duty-free status being claimed for the <br /> articles purchased by Importer D from Pro- <br /> ducer C. Therefore, the consequences of Pro- <br /> ducer C's failure to meet the 50% value-con- <br /> tent requirement include the denial of pref- <br /> erential tariff treatment for all articles that <br /> are wholly assembled in Haiti by Producer C <br /> and entered during the initial applicable <br /> one-year period, except for those articles sold <br /> by Producer C to Importer D. An additional <br /> consequence of Producer C's failure to meet <br /> the value-content requirement in the initial <br /> applicable one-year period is that articles <br /> wholly assembled in Haiti by Producer C and <br /> entered during succeeding applicable one- <br /> year periods will be ineligible for duty-free <br /> treatment until the appropriate increased <br /> value-content requirement has been met (see <br /> \u00a7 10.844(a)(4)(i)(C) of this subpart), except to <br /> the extent the articles qualify for preference <br /> under \u00a7 10.845 of this subpart. <br /> (iv) Increased percentage. For apparel <br /> articles of a producer or entity control- <br /> ling production to meet the increased <br /> percentage referred to in paragraphs <br /> (a)(4)(i)(C) and (a)(4)(ii)(B) of this sec- <br /> tion, the sum of the cost or value of <br /> the materials produced in Haiti or one <br /> or more eligible countries described in <br /> paragraph (c) of this section, or any <br /> combination thereof, plus the direct <br /> costs of processing operations per- <br /> formed in Haiti or one or more eligible <br /> countries described in paragraph (c) of <br /> this section, or any combination there- <br /> of, must not be less than the applicable <br /> percentage under paragraph (a)(1) of <br /> this section, plus 10 percent, of the ag- <br /> gregate declared customs value of all <br /> apparel articles of that producer or en- <br /> tity controlling production that are <br /> wholly assembled or knit-to-shape in <br /> Haiti and are entered during the imme- <br /> diately preceding applicable one-year <br /> period. Once the increased value-con- <br /> tent percentage has been met for the <br /> articles of a producer or entity control- <br /> ling production that are entered during <br /> an applicable one-year period, the arti- <br /> cles of that producer or entity control- <br /> ling production that are entered during <br /> the next succeeding applicable one- <br /> year period will be subject to the appli- <br /> cable value-content percentage speci- <br /> fied in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. <br /> (v) Articles of a new producer or entity <br /> controlling production. Apparel articles <br /> of a new producer or entity controlling <br /> production electing to use the annual <br /> aggregation method for purposes of <br /> meeting the applicable value-content <br /> requirement must first meet the in- <br /> creased value-content percentage spec- <br /> ified in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this sec- <br /> tion as a prerequisite to receiving <br /> duty-free treatment during a suc- <br /> ceeding applicable one-year period. Ap- <br /> parel articles of a new producer or enti- <br /> ty controlling production electing to <br /> use the individual entry method are <br /> not subject to the requirement of first <br /> meeting the increased value-content <br /> percentage as a prerequisite to receiv- <br /> ing duty-free treatment during the <br /> first year of participation or in any <br /> succeeding applicable one-year period. <br /> For purposes of this paragraph, a ''new <br /> producer or entity controlling produc- <br /> tion'' is a producer or entity control- <br /> ling production that did not produce or <br /> control production of articles that <br /> were entered as articles pursuant to <br /> \u00a7 10.843(a) of this subpart during the im- <br /> mediately preceding applicable one- <br /> year period. <br /> Example 1. A Haitian producer begins pro- <br /> duction of apparel articles that meet the de- <br /> scription in \u00a7 10.843(a) of this subpart during <br /> the second applicable one-year period and <br /> elects to use the annual aggregation method <br /> for each applicable one-year period. The pro- <br /> ducer's articles entered during the second <br /> applicable one-year period meet a value-con- <br /> tent percentage of 55%; articles entered dur- <br /> ing the third applicable one-year period meet <br /> a value-content percentage of 65%; and arti- <br /> cles entered during the fourth applicable <br /> one-year period meet a value-content per- <br /> centage of 55%. The producer's articles may <br /> not receive duty-free treatment during the <br /> second applicable one-year period because <br /> there was no production (and thus no entered <br /> articles) during the immediately preceding <br /> period (the initial applicable one-year pe- <br /> riod) on which to assess compliance with the <br /> applicable value-content requirement. The <br /> producer's articles also may not receive <br /> duty-free treatment during the third applica- <br /> ble one-year period because the increased <br /> value-content percentage requirement (50% <br /> plus 10% = 60%) was not met in the imme- <br /> diately preceding period (the second applica- <br /> ble one-year period). However, the producer's <br /> articles are eligible for duty-free treatment <br /> during the fourth applicable one-year period <br /> based on compliance with the 60% value-con- <br /> tent percentage requirement in the imme- <br /> diately preceding period (the third applicable <br /> one-year period). The producer's articles also <br /> are eligible for duty-free treatment during <br /> the fifth applicable one-year period based on <br /> compliance with the 55% value-content per- <br /> centage requirement in the immediately pre- <br /> ceding period (the fourth applicable one-year <br /> period). <br /> Example 2. Same facts as in example 1, ex- <br /> cept that the producer elects to use the indi- <br /> vidual entry method for purposes of meeting <br /> the applicable value-content requirement for <br /> each applicable one-year period. The pro- <br /> ducer's articles entered during the second <br /> applicable one-year period are eligible for <br /> duty-free treatment because these articles <br /> meet the requisite 50% value-content re- <br /> quirement. The producer's articles also may <br /> receive duty-free treatment during the third, <br /> fourth, and fifth applicable one-year periods <br /> based on compliance with the applicable <br /> value-content requirements for each of those <br /> periods set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this <br /> section. <br /> (vi) Notification of compliance with the <br /> increased percentage-(A) General. If ap- <br /> parel articles of a producer or entity <br /> controlling production are required to <br /> meet the increased value-content per- <br /> centage described in paragraph <br /> (a)(4)(iv) of this section, either because <br /> of failure to meet the requirements of <br /> \u00a7 10.843(a) or the applicable value-con- <br /> tent requirement set forth in para- <br /> graph (a) of this section in an applica- <br /> ble one-year period, or because the pro- <br /> ducer or entity controlling production <br /> is a new producer or entity controlling <br /> production, as defined in paragraph <br /> (a)(4)(v) of this section, that elects to <br /> use the annual aggregation method, <br /> the importer of such articles must no- <br /> tify CBP that the increased percentage <br /> has been met in an applicable one-year <br /> period by submitting to CBP the dec- <br /> laration of compliance described in <br /> \u00a710.848 of this subpart within 30 days <br /> following the end of the applicable one- <br /> year period. An importer that is re- <br /> quired to submit a declaration of com- <br /> pliance under this paragraph must sub- <br /> mit such a declaration for each im- <br /> porter of record identification number <br /> used by that importer. A declaration of <br /> compliance required under this para- <br /> graph must be sent to the address set <br /> forth in \u00a7 10.848(a) of this subpart. <br /> (B) Contents. A declaration of compli- <br /> ance required under paragraph <br /> (a)(4)(v)(A) of this section must in- <br /> clude, in addition to the information <br /> specified in \u00a7 10.848(c) of this subpart, a <br /> statement as to whether the increased <br /> value-content percentage was required <br /> because the apparel articles failed to <br /> meet the production standards or the <br /> applicable value-content requirement <br /> or because the producer or entity con- <br /> trolling production was a new producer <br /> or entity controlling production that <br /> elected to use the annual aggregation <br /> method. <br /> (C) Effect of noncompliance. If an im- <br /> porter fails to submit to CBP the dec- <br /> laration of compliance required under <br /> paragraph (a)(4)(v)(A) of this section <br /> within 30 days following the end of the <br /> applicable one-year period during <br /> which the increased value-content per- <br /> centage was met for apparel articles of <br /> a producer or entity controlling pro- <br /> duction, CBP may deny duty-free <br /> treatment to all apparel articles, as de- <br /> scribed in \u00a7 10.843(a) of this subpart, of <br /> that producer or entity controlling <br /> production that are entered by that <br /> importer during the next succeeding <br /> applicable one-year period. Addition- <br /> ally, the timely submission of a dec- <br /> laration of compliance is a prerequisite <br /> for a producer or entity controlling <br /> production to request retroactive ap- <br /> plication of duty-free treatment under <br /> \u00a710.845 of this subpart for apparel arti- <br /> cles that meet the increased value-con- <br /> tent percentage during an applicable <br /> one-year period. However, the submis- <br /> sion of a declaration of compliance is <br /> not a substitute for filing a request for <br /> liquidation or reliquidation of an entry <br /> for which retroactive duty-free treat- <br /> ment is sought under \u00a710.845 of this <br /> subpart. <br /> (5) Inclusion of the cost of fabrics or <br /> yarns not available in commercial quan- <br /> tities in value-content requirement. For <br /> purposes of meeting the applicable <br /> value-content requirement set forth in <br /> paragraph (a) of this section, either in <br /> regard to individual entries or entries <br /> entered in the aggregate, the following <br /> costs may be included: <br /> (i) The cost of fabrics or yarns to the <br /> extent that apparel articles of such <br /> fabrics or yarns would be eligible for <br /> preferential treatment, without regard <br /> to the source of the fabrics or yarns, <br /> under Annex 401 of the NAFTA; and <br /> (ii) The cost of fabrics or yarns (with- <br /> out regard to their source) that are <br /> designated as not being available in <br /> commercial quantities for purposes of: <br /> (A) Section 213(b)(2)(A)(v) of the <br /> CBERA (19 U.S.C. 2703(b)(2)(A)(v)); <br /> (B) Section 112(b)(5) of the African <br /> Growth and Opportunity Act (19 U.S.C. <br /> 3721(b)(5)); <br /> (C) Section 204(b)(3)(B)(i)(III) or <br /> 204(b)(3)(B)(ii) of the Andean Trade <br /> Preference Act (19 U.S.C. <br /> 3203(b)(3)(B)(i)(III) or 3203(b)(3)(B)(ii)); <br /> or <br /> (D) Any other provision, relating to <br /> determining whether a textile or ap- <br /> parel article is an originating good eli- <br /> gible for preferential treatment, of a <br /> law that implements a free trade agree- <br /> ment that enters into force with re- <br /> spect to the United States. <br /> (b) Wiring sets. An article described in <br /> \u00a7 10.843(d) of this subpart will be eligi- <br /> ble for duty-free treatment during the <br /> five-year period ending on December <br /> 19, 2011, only if the sum of the cost or <br /> value of the materials produced in <br /> Haiti or one or more eligible countries <br /> described in paragraph (c) of this sec- <br /> tion, or any combination thereof, plus <br /> the direct costs of processing oper- <br /> ations performed in Haiti or the United <br /> States, or both, is not less than 50 per- <br /> cent of the declared customs value of <br /> the article. <br /> (c) Eligible countries described. As used <br /> in this section, the term ''eligible <br /> countries'' includes: <br /> (1) The United States; <br /> (2) Israel, Canada, Mexico, Jordan, <br /> Singapore, Chile, Australia, Morocco, <br /> Bahrain, El Salvador, Honduras, Nica- <br /> ragua, Guatemala, Dominican Repub- <br /> lic, and any other country that is a <br /> party to a free trade agreement with <br /> the United States that is in effect on <br /> December 20, 2006, or that enters into <br /> force thereafter; and <br /> (3) The designated beneficiary coun- <br /> tries listed in General Notes 11 (Andean <br /> Trade Preference Act), 16 (African <br /> Growth and Opportunity Act), and 17 <br /> (Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership <br /> Act) of the HTSUS. <br /> (d) Cost or value of materials-(1) Mate- <br /> rials produced in Haiti or one or more eli- <br /> gible countries described in paragraph (c) <br /> of this section defined-(i) Certain ap- <br /> parel articles. As used in paragraph (a) <br /> of this section, the words ''materials <br /> produced in Haiti or one or more eligi- <br /> ble countries described in paragraph (c) <br /> of this section'' refer to those mate- <br /> rials incorporated into an article that <br /> are either: <br /> (A) Wholly obtained or produced, <br /> within the meaning of \u00a7 102.1(g) of this <br /> chapter, in Haiti or one or more eligi- <br /> ble countries described in paragraph (c) <br /> of this section; or <br /> (B) Determined to originate in Haiti <br /> or one or more eligible countries de- <br /> scribed in paragraph (c) of this section <br /> by application of the provisions of <br /> \u00a7 102.21 of this chapter. <br /> (ii) Wiring sets. As used in paragraph <br /> (b) of this section, the words ''mate- <br /> rials produced in Haiti or one or more <br /> eligible countries described in para- <br /> graph (c) of this section'' refer to those <br /> materials incorporated into an article <br /> that are either: <br /> (A) Wholly the growth, product, or <br /> manufacture of Haiti or one or more el- <br /> igible countries described in paragraph <br /> (c) of this section; or <br /> (B) Substantially transformed in <br /> Haiti or one or more eligible countries <br /> described in paragraph (c) of this sec- <br /> tion into a new or different article of <br /> commerce which is then used in Haiti <br /> in the production of a new or different <br /> article of commerce that is imported <br /> into the United States. <br /> (2) Determination of cost or value of <br /> materials-(i) Costs included. (A) For <br /> purposes of paragraphs (a) and (b) of <br /> this section, and subject to paragraphs <br /> (d)(2)(i)(B) and (d)(2)(ii) of this section, <br /> the cost or value of materials produced <br /> in Haiti or one or more eligible coun- <br /> tries described in paragraph (c) of this <br /> section includes: <br /> (1) The manufacturer's actual cost <br /> for the materials; <br /> (2) When not included in the manu- <br /> facturer's actual cost for the materials, <br /> the freight, insurance, packing, and all <br /> other costs incurred in transporting <br /> the materials to the manufacturer's <br /> plant; <br /> (3) The actual cost of waste or spoil- <br /> age, less the value of recoverable scrap; <br /> and <br /> (4) Taxes and/or duties imposed on <br /> the materials by Haiti or one or more <br /> eligible countries described in para- <br /> graph (c) of this section, provided they <br /> are not remitted upon exportation. <br /> (B) Where a material is provided to <br /> the manufacturer without charge, or at <br /> less than fair market value, its cost or <br /> value will be determined by computing <br /> the sum of: <br /> (1) All expenses incurred in the <br /> growth, production, or manufacture of <br /> the material, including general ex- <br /> penses; <br /> (2) An amount for profit; and <br /> (3) Freight, insurance, packing, and <br /> all other costs incurred in transporting <br /> the material to the manufacturer's <br /> plant. <br /> (ii) Costs deducted in regard to certain <br /> apparel articles. For purposes of para- <br /> graph (a) of this section, in calculating <br /> the cost or value of materials produced <br /> in Haiti or one or more eligible coun- <br /> tries described in paragraph (c) of this <br /> section, either in regard to individual <br /> entries or entries entered in the aggre- <br /> gate, deductions are to be made for the <br /> cost or value of: <br /> (A) Any foreign materials used in the <br /> production of the apparel articles in <br /> Haiti; and <br /> (B) Any foreign materials used in the <br /> production of the materials produced <br /> in Haiti or one or more eligible coun- <br /> tries described in paragraph (c) of this <br /> section. <br /> (e) Direct costs of processing oper- <br /> ations-(1) Items included. As used in <br /> paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, <br /> the words ''direct costs of processing <br /> operations'' mean those costs either di- <br /> rectly incurred in, or which can be rea- <br /> sonably allocated to, the growth, pro- <br /> duction, manufacture, or assembly of <br /> the specific articles under consider- <br /> ation.

A Haitian producer of articles <br> that meet the description in \u00a7 10.843(a) of this <br> subpart begins exporting those articles to <br> the United States during the initial applica- <br> ble one-year period and elects to use the an- <br> nual aggregation method for purposes of <br> meeting the applicable value-content re- <br> quirement. The articles entered during that <br> initial period meet a value-content percent- <br> age of 48%, while articles entered during the <br> second applicable one-year period meet a <br> value-content percentage of 62%. The pro- <br> ducer's articles may not receive duty-free <br> treatment during the initial applicable one- <br> year period because the requisite 50% value- <br> content requirement was not met. The pro- <br> ducer's articles also are ineligible for duty- <br> free treatment during the second applicable <br> one-year period because the 50% value-con- <br> tent requirement was not met in the imme- <br> diately preceding period (the initial applica- <br> ble one-year period).

<br> (B) In the case of fabric for which the <br> cost cannot be determined under para- <br> graph (a)(5)(ii)(A) of this section or if <br> CBP finds that cost to be unreasonable, <br> all reasonable expenses incurred in the <br> the fabric, including the cost or value <br> of materials (which includes the cost of <br> non-recoverable scrap generated in the <br> growth, production, or manufacture of <br> the fabric), general expenses and em- <br> broidering and dyeing, printing, and <br> finishing expenses, plus a reasonable <br> amount for profit, and the freight, in- <br> surance, packing, and other costs, if <br> any, incurred in transporting the fabric <br> to the port of exportation; <br> (C) In the case of fabric components <br> purchased by the producer or entity <br> controlling production, the f.o.b. port <br> of exportation price of those fabric <br> components as set out in the invoice or <br> other commercial documents, less the <br> cost or value of any non-textile mate- <br> rials, and less expenses for cutting or <br> other processing to create the fabric <br> components other than knitting to <br> shape, that the producer or entity con- <br> trolling production can verify, or, if <br> the price is other than f.o.b. port of ex- <br> portation: <br> (1) The price as set out in the invoice <br> justed to arrive at an f.o.b. port of ex- <br> portation price, less the cost or value <br> of any non-textile materials, and less <br> expenses for cutting or other proc- <br> essing to create the fabric components <br> tion can verify;

and <br> (D) In the case of fabric components <br> for which a fabric cost cannot be deter- <br> mined under paragraph (a)(5)(ii)(C) of <br> this section or if CBP finds that cost to <br> be unreasonable: all reasonable ex- <br> penses incurred in the growth, produc- <br> tion, or manufacture of the fabric com- <br> ponents, including the cost or value of <br> materials (which does not include the <br> cost of recoverable scrap generated in <br> the growth, production, or manufac- <br> ture of the fabric components) and gen- <br> eral expenses, but excluding the cost or <br> excluding expenses for cutting or other <br> processing to create the fabric compo- <br> nents other than knitting to shape, <br> that the producer or entity controlling <br> production can verify, plus a reason- <br> able amount for profit, and the freight, <br> insurance, packing, and other costs, if <br> components to the port of exportation. <br> (6) Year. @^@Year@^@ means a 12-month <br> period beginning on October 1 and end- <br> ing on September 30 but does not in- <br> clude any 12-month period that began <br> prior to October 1, 2000. <br> (7) Entered. @^@Entered@^@ means entered, <br> or withdrawn from warehouse for con- <br> sumption, in the customs territory of <br> (b) Limitations on preferential treat- <br> ment\u2014(1) General. During the year that <br> begins on October 1, 2002, and during <br> any subsequent year, articles of a pro- <br> ducer or an entity controlling produc- <br> tion that conform to the production <br> standards set forth in \u00a7 10.223(a)(6) will <br> be eligible for preferential treatment <br> only if: <br> (i) The aggregate cost of fabrics (ex- <br> clusive of all findings and trimmings) <br> formed in the United States that were <br> used in the production of all of those <br> articles of that producer or that entity <br> as articles described in \u00a7 10.223(a)(6) <br> during the immediately preceding year <br> was at least 75 percent of the aggregate <br> declared customs value of the fabric <br> (exclusive of all findings and trim- <br> mings) contained in all of those arti- <br> controlling production that are entered <br> during that year; or <br> (ii) In a case in which the 75 percent <br> requirement set forth in paragraph <br> (b)(1)(i) of this section was not met <br> during a year and therefore those arti- <br> cles of that producer or that entity <br> controlling production were not eligi- <br> ble for preferential treatment during <br> the following year, the aggregate cost <br> of fabrics (exclusive of all findings and <br> trimmings) formed in the United <br> States that were used in the produc- <br> tion of all of those articles of that pro- <br> ducer or that entity controlling pro- <br> duction that conform to the production <br> standards set forth in \u00a7 10.223(a)(6) and <br> that were entered during the imme- <br> diately preceding year was at least 85 <br> percent of the aggregate declared cus- <br> toms value of the fabric (exclusive of <br> all findings and trimmings) contained <br> in all of those articles of that producer <br> or that entity controlling production <br> that conform to the production stand- <br> ards set forth in \u00a7 10.223(a)(6) and that <br> were entered during that year; and <br> (iii) In conjunction with the filing of <br> the claim for preferential treatment <br> under \u00a710.225, the importer records on <br> the entry summary or warehouse with- <br> drawal for consumption (CBP Form <br> 7501, column 34), or its electronic <br> equivalent, the distinct and unique <br> identifier assigned by CBP to the appli- <br> cable documentation prescribed under <br> paragraph (c) of this section. <br> (2) Rules of application\u2014(i) General. <br> For purposes of paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and <br> (b)(1)(ii) of this section and for pur- <br> poses of preparing and filing the docu- <br> mentation prescribed in paragraph (c) <br> of this section, the following rules will <br> apply: <br> (A) The articles in question must <br> have been produced in the manner <br> specified in \u00a7 10.223(a)(6) and the arti- <br> cles in question must be entered within <br> the same year; <br> (B) Articles that are exported to <br> countries other than the United States <br> and are never entered are not to be <br> considered in determining compliance <br> with the 75 or 85 percent standard spec- <br> ified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) or paragraph <br> (b)(1)(ii) of this section; <br> (C) Articles that are entered under an <br> HTSUS subheading other than the <br> HTSUS subheading which pertains to <br> articles described in \u00a7 10.223(a)(6) are <br> not to be considered in determining <br> compliance with the 75 percent stand- <br> ard specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of <br> this section; <br> (D) For purposes of determining com- <br> pliance with the 85 percent standard <br> section, all articles that conform to <br> the production standards set forth in <br> \u00a7 10.223(a)(6) must be considered, re- <br> gardless of the HTSUS subheading <br> under which they were entered; <br> (E) Fabric components and fabrics <br> that constitute findings or trimmings <br> are not to be considered in determining <br> compliance with the 75 or 85 percent <br> standard specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) <br> or paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section; <br> (F) Beginning October 1, 2002, in <br> order for articles to be eligible for pref- <br> erential treatment in a given year, a <br> producer of, or entity controlling pro- <br> duction of, those articles must have <br> met the 75 percent standard specified <br> in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section <br> during the immediately preceding <br> year. If articles of a producer or entity <br> controlling production fail to meet the <br> 75 percent standard specified in para- <br> graph (b)(1)(i) of this section during a <br> year, articles of that producer or enti- <br> ty controlling production: <br> (1) Will not be eligible for pref- <br> erential treatment during the fol- <br> lowing year; <br> (2) Will remain ineligible for pref- <br> erential treatment until the year that <br> follows a year in which articles of that <br> producer or entity controlling produc- <br> tion met the 85 percent standard speci- <br> fied in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this sec- <br> tion; and <br> (3) After the 85 percent standard <br> specified in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this <br> section has been met, will again be sub- <br> ject to the 75 percent standard speci- <br> fied in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this sec- <br> tion during the following year for pur- <br> poses of determining eligibility for <br> preferential treatment in the next <br> year. <br> (G) A new producer or new entity <br> controlling production, that is, a pro- <br> ducer or entity controlling production <br> which did not produce or control pro- <br> duction of articles that were entered as <br> articles described in \u00a7 10.223(a)(6) during <br> the immediately preceding year, must <br> first establish compliance with the 85 <br> percent standard specified in paragraph <br> (b)(1)(ii) of this section as a pre- <br> requisite to preparation of the declara- <br> tion of compliance referred to in para- <br> graph (c) of this section; <br> (H) A declaration of compliance pre- <br> pared by a producer or by an entity <br> controlling production must cover all <br> production of that producer or all pro- <br> duction that the entity controls for the <br> year in question; <br> (I) A producer is not required to pre- <br> pare a declaration of compliance if all <br> of its production is covered by a dec- <br> laration of compliance prepared by an <br> entity controlling production; <br> (J) In the case of a producer, the 75 or <br> 85 percent standard specified in para- <br> graph (b)(1)(i) or paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of <br> this section and the declaration of <br> compliance procedure under paragraph <br> (c) of this section apply to all articles <br> of that producer for the year in ques- <br> tion, even if some but not all of that <br> production is also covered by a declara- <br> tion of compliance prepared by an enti- <br> ty controlling production; <br> (K) The U.S. importer does not have <br> to be the producer or the entity con- <br> trolling production who prepared the <br> declaration of compliance; and <br> (L) The exclusion references regard- <br> ing findings and trimmings in para- <br> graph (b)(1)(i) and paragraph (b)(1)(ii) <br> of this section apply to all findings and <br> trimmings, whether or not they are of <br> foreign origin. <br> (ii) Examples. The following examples <br> will illustrate application of the prin- <br> ciples set forth in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of <br> this section. <br> Example 1. A CBTPA beneficiary country <br> producer of articles that meet the produc- <br> tion standards specified in \u00a710.223(a)(6) in the <br> first year sends 50 percent of that production <br> to CBTPA region markets and the other 50 <br> percent to the U.S. market; the cost of the <br> fabrics formed in the United States equals <br> 100 percent of the value of all of the fabric in <br> the articles sent to the CBTPA region and 60 <br> percent of the value of all of the fabric in the <br> articles sent to the United States. Although <br> the cost of fabrics formed in the United <br> States is more than 75 percent of the value of <br> all of the fabric used in all of the articles <br> produced, this producer could not prepare a <br> valid declaration of compliance because the <br> articles sent to the United States did not <br> meet the minimum 75 percent standard. <br> Example 2. A producer sends to the United <br> States in the first year three shipments of <br> articles that meet the description in <br> \u00a7 10.223(a)(6); one of those shipments is en- <br> tered under the HTSUS subheading that cov- <br> ers articles described in \u00a710.223(a)(6), the sec- <br> ond shipment is entered under the HTSUS <br> subheading that covers articles described in <br> \u00a7 10.223(a)(12), and the third shipment is en- <br> tered under subheading 9802.00.80, HTSUS. In <br> determining whether the minimum 75 per- <br> cent standard has been met in the first year <br> for purposes of entry of articles under the <br> HTSUS subheading that covers articles de- <br> scribed in \u00a7 10.223(a)(6) during the following <br> (that is, second) year, consideration must be <br> restricted to the articles in the first ship- <br> ment and therefore must not include the ar- <br> ticles in the second and third shipments. <br> Example 3. A producer in the second year <br> begins production of articles that conform to <br> the production standards specified in <br> \u00a7 10.223(a)(6); some of those articles are en- <br> tered in that year under HTSUS subheading <br> 6212.10 and others under HTSUS subheading <br> 9802.00.80 but none are entered in that year <br> under the HTSUS subheading which pertains <br> to articles described in \u00a710.223(a)(6) because <br> the 75 percent standard had not been met in <br> the preceding (that is, first) year. In this <br> case the 85 percent standard applies, and all <br> of the articles that were entered under the <br> various HTSUS provisions in the second year <br> must be taken into account in determining <br> whether that 85 percent standard has been <br> met. If the 85 percent was met in the aggre- <br> gate for all of the articles entered in the sec- <br> ond year, in the next (that is, third) year ar- <br> ticles of that producer may receive pref- <br> erential treatment under the HTSUS sub- <br> heading which pertains to articles described <br> in \u00a710.223(a)(6). <br> Example 4. An entity controlling produc- <br> tion of articles that meet the description in <br> \u00a710.223(a)(6) buys for the U.S., Canadian and <br> Mexican markets; the articles in each case <br> are first sent to the United States where <br> they are entered for consumption and then <br> placed in a commercial warehouse from <br> which they are shipped to various stores in <br> the United States, Canada and Mexico. Not- <br> withstanding the fact that some of the arti- <br> cles ultimately ended up in Canada or Mex- <br> ico, a declaration of compliance prepared by <br> the entity controlling production must cover <br> all of the articles rather than only those <br> that remained in the United States because <br> all of those articles had been entered for con- <br> sumption. <br> Example 5. Fabric is cut and sewn in the <br> United States with other U.S. materials to <br> form cups which are joined together to form <br> brassiere front subassemblies in the United <br> States, and those front subassemblies are <br> then placed in a warehouse in the United <br> States where they are held until the fol- <br> lowing year; during that following year all of <br> the front subassemblies are shipped to a <br> CBTPA beneficiary country where they are <br> assembled with elastic strips and labels pro- <br> duced in an Asian country and other fabrics, <br> components or materials produced in the <br> CBTPA beneficiary country to form articles <br> that meet the production standards specified <br> in \u00a710.223(a)(6) and that are then shipped to <br> the United States and entered during that <br> same year. In determining whether the en- <br> tered articles meet the minimum 75 or 85 <br> percent standard, the fabric in the elastic <br> strips and labels is to be disregarded entirely <br> because the strips and labels constitute find- <br> ings or trimmings for purposes of this sec- <br> tion, and all of the fabric in the front sub- <br> assemblies is countable because it was all <br> formed in the United States and used in the <br> production of articles that were entered in <br> the same year. <br> Example 6. A CBTPA beneficiary country <br> producer's entire production of articles that <br> meet the description in \u00a7 10.223(a)(6) is sent <br> to a U.S. importer in two separate ship- <br> ments, one in February and the other in <br> June of the same calendar year; the articles <br> shipped in February do not meet the min- <br> imum 75 percent standard, the articles <br> shipped in June exceed the 85 percent stand- <br> ard, and the articles in the two shipments, <br> taken together, do meet the 75 percent <br> standard; the articles covered by the Feb- <br> ruary shipment are entered for consumption <br> on March 1 of that calendar year, and the ar- <br> ticles covered by the June shipment are <br> placed in a CBP bonded warehouse upon ar- <br> rival and are subsequently withdrawn from <br> warehouse for consumption on November 1 of <br> that calendar year. The CBTPA beneficiary <br> country producer may not prepare a valid <br> declaration of compliance covering the arti- <br> cles in the first shipment because those arti- <br> cles did not meet the minimum 75 percent <br> standard and because those articles cannot <br> be included with the articles of the second <br> shipment on the same declaration of compli- <br> ance since they were entered in a different <br> year. However, the CBTPA beneficiary coun- <br> try producer may prepare a valid declaration <br> of compliance covering the articles in the <br> second shipment because those articles did <br> meet the requisite 85 percent standard which <br> would apply for purposes of entry of articles <br> in the following year. <br> Example 7. A producer in the second year <br> begins production of articles exclusively for <br> the U.S. market that meet the production <br> standards specified in \u00a7 10.223(a)(6), but the <br> entered articles do not meet the requisite 85 <br> percent standard until the third year; the en- <br> tered articles fail to meet the 75 percent <br> standard in the fourth year; and the entered <br> articles do not attain the 85 percent standard <br> until the sixth year. The producer's articles <br> may not receive preferential treatment dur- <br> ing the second year because there was no <br> production (and thus there were no entered <br> articles) in the immediately preceding (that <br> is, first) year on which to assess compliance <br> with the 75 percent standard. The producer's <br> articles also may not receive preferential <br> treatment during the third year because the <br> 85 percent standard was not met in the im- <br> mediately preceding (that is, second) year. <br> However, the producer's articles are eligible <br> for preferential treatment during the fourth <br> year based on compliance with the 85 percent <br> standard in the immediately preceding (that <br> is, third) year. The producer's articles may <br> not receive preferential treatment during <br> the fifth year because the 75 percent stand- <br> ard was not met in the immediately pre- <br> ceding (that is, fourth) year. The producer's <br> articles may not receive preferential treat- <br> ment during the sixth year because the 85 <br> percent standard has become applicable and <br> was not met in the immediately preceding <br> (that is, fifth) year. The producer's articles <br> are eligible for preferential treatment during <br> the seventh year because the 85 percent <br> standard was met in the immediately pre- <br> ceding (that is, sixth) year, and during that <br> seventh year the 75 percent standard is appli- <br> cable for purposes of determining whether <br> the producer's articles are eligible for pref- <br> erential treatment in the following (that is, <br> eighth) year. <br> Example 8. An entity controlling produc- <br> tion (Entity A) uses five CBTPA beneficiary <br> country producers (Producers 1-5), all of <br> which produce only articles that meet the <br> description in \u00a7 10.223(a)(6); Producers 1-4 <br> send all of their production to the United <br> States and Producer 5 sends 10 percent of its <br> production to the United States and the rest <br> to Europe; Producers 1-3 and Producer 5 <br> produce only pursuant to contracts with En- <br> tity A, but Producer 4 also operates inde- <br> pendently of Entity A by producing for sev- <br> eral U.S. importers, one of which is an entity <br> controlling production (Entity B) that also <br> controls all of the production of articles of <br> one other producer (Producer 6) which sends <br> all of its production to the United States. A <br> declaration of compliance prepared by Enti- <br> ty A must cover all of the articles of Pro- <br> ducers 1-3 and the 10 percent of articles of <br> Producer 5 that are sent to the United States <br> and that portion of the articles of Producer <br> 4 that are produced pursuant to the contract <br> with Entity A, because Entity A controls the <br> production of those articles. There is no need <br> for Producers 1-3 and Producer 5 to prepare <br> a declaration of compliance because they <br> have no production that is not covered by a <br> declaration of compliance prepared by an en- <br> tity controlling production. A declaration of <br> compliance prepared by Producer 4 would <br> cover all of its production, that is, articles <br> produced for Entity A, articles produced for <br> Entity B, and articles produced independ- <br> ently for other U.S. importers; a declaration <br> of compliance prepared by Entity B must <br> cover that portion of the production of Pro- <br> ducer 4 that it controls as well as all of the <br> production of Producer 6 because Entity B <br> also controls all of the production of Pro- <br> ducer 6. Producer 6 would not prepare a dec- <br> laration of compliance because all of its pro- <br> duction is covered by the declaration of com- <br> pliance prepared by Entity B. <br> (c) Documentation\u2014(1) Initial declara- <br> tion of compliance. In order for an im- <br> porter to comply with the requirement <br> set forth in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this <br> section, the producer or the entity con- <br> trolling production must have filed <br> with CBP, in accordance with para- <br> graph (c)(4) of this section, a declara- <br> tion of compliance with the applicable <br> 75 or 85 percent requirement prescribed <br> In paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii) of this <br> section. After filing of the declaration <br> of compliance has been completed, CBP <br> will advise the producer or the entity <br> controlling production of the distinct <br> and unique identifier assigned to that <br> declaration. The producer or the entity <br> controlling production will then be re- <br> sponsible for advising each appropriate <br> U.S. importer of that distinct and <br> unique identifier for purposes of re- <br> cording that identifier on the entry <br> summary or warehouse withdrawal. In <br> order to provide sufficient time for ad- <br> vising the U.S. importer of that dis- <br> tinct and unique identifier prior to the <br> arrival of the articles in the United <br> States, the producer or the entity con- <br> trolling production should file the dec- <br> laration of compliance with CBP at <br> least 10 calendar days prior to the date <br> of the first shipment of the articles to <br> the United States. <br> (2) Amended declaration of compliance. <br> If the information on the declaration of <br> compliance referred to in paragraph <br> (c)(1) of this section is based on an esti- <br> mate because final year-end informa- <br> tion was not available at that time and <br> the final data differs from the esti- <br> mate, or if the producer or the entity <br> controlling production has reason to <br> believe for any other reason that the <br> declaration of compliance that was <br> filed contained erroneous information, <br> within 30 calendar days after the final <br> year-end information becomes avail- <br> able or within 30 calendar days after <br> the date of discovery of the error: <br> (i) The producer or the entity con- <br> trolling production must file with the <br> CBP office identified in paragraph <br> (c)(4) of this section an amended dec- <br> laration of compliance containing that <br> final year-end information or other <br> corrected information; or <br> (ii) If that final year-end information <br> or other corrected information dem- <br> onstrates noncompliance with the ap- <br> plicable 75 or 85 percent requirement, <br> the producer or the entity controlling <br> production must in writing advise both <br> the CBP office identified in paragraph <br> (c)(4) of this section and each appro- <br> priate U.S. importer of that fact. <br> (3) Form and preparation of declaration <br> of compliance\u2014(i) Form.

This Annex sets out rules for all products, but the fact that a product is included in it does not mean that it is<br /> necessarily covered by the scheme of generalised tariff preferences (GSP) of Switzerland.<br /> 1.2. This Annex lays down the conditions pursuant to Article 6 of Federal Ordinance of 30 March 2011 on Rules<br /> of Origin for the Swiss Generalized System of Preferences (RS 946.39). There are four different types of<br /> rules, which vary according to the product:<br /> (a) through a maximum content of non-originating materials allowed in a obtained product;<br /> (b) through working or processing the 4-digit Harmonized System (HS) headings or 6-digit HS sub-headings<br /> of the manufactured products becomes different from the 4-digit HS headings or 6-digit sub-headings<br /> respectively of the materials used;<br /> (c) a specific working and processing operation is carried out;<br /> (d) working or processing is carried out on certain wholly obtained materials.<br /> Note 2<br /> 2.1. The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column gives the HS heading<br /> number or chapter number used in the HS and the second column gives the description of goods used<br /> in that system for that HS heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns one or more rules<br /> (\"qualifying operations\") are set out in column 3. These qualifying operations concern only non-originating<br /> materials. Where, in some cases, the entry in column 1 is preceded by \"ex\", this signifies that the rule in<br /> column 3 applies only to the part of that HS heading as described in column 2.<br /> 2.2. Where several HS heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number is given and the<br /> description of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rule in column 3 applies<br /> to all products which, under the HS, are classified in HS headings of the chapter or in any of the HS headings<br /> grouped together in column 1.<br /> 2.3. Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a HS heading, each indent<br /> contains the description of that part of the HS heading covered by the adjacent rule in column 3.<br /> 2.4. Where two alternative rules are set out in column 3, separated by \"or\", it is at the choice of the exporter<br /> which one to use.<br /> 2.5. For some products less stringent rules shall apply for products originating in LDCs. In these cases, column<br /> 3 is split into two sub-columns, (a) and (b), with sub-column (a) showing the rule applicable to LDCs and<br /> sub-column (b) showing the rule applicable to all other beneficiary countries.<br /> Note 3<br /> 3.1. Article 6, concerning products having acquired originating status which are used in the manufacture of other<br /> products, shall apply, regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where these<br /> products are used or in another factory in the beneficiary country or in Switzerland.<br /> ANNEX 4: LIST OF WORKING OR PROCESSING REQUIRED TO BE CARRIED OUT ON NON-ORIGINATING<br /> MATERIALS IN ORDER THAT THE PRODUCT MANUFACTURED CAN OBTAIN ORIGINATING STATUS<br /> Example: An engine of HS heading 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-originating<br /> materials which may be incorporated may not exceed 50 per cent of the ex-works price (70 per cent for a<br /> LDC), is made from \"other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging\" of HS heading ex 7224.<br /> If this forging has been forged in a beneficiary country concerned or in Switzerland from a non-originating<br /> ingot, it has already acquired originating status by virtue of the rule for HS heading ex 7224 in the list. The<br /> forging can then count as originating in the value calculation for the engine regardless of whether it was<br /> produced in the same factory or in another factory in the beneficiary country concerned. The value of the<br /> non-originating ingot is thus not taken into account when adding up the value of the non-originating materials<br /> used.<br /> 3.2. The rules in the list represent the minimum amount of working or processing required, and the carrying-out<br /> of more working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the carrying-out of less working or<br /> processing cannot confer originating status. Thus, if a rule provides that non-originating material, at a certain<br /> level of manufacture, may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed,<br /> and the use of such material at a later stage is not.<br /> 3.3. Without prejudice to Note 3.2, where a rule uses the expression \"Manufacture from materials of any HS<br /> heading\", then materials of any HS heading(s) (even materials of the same description and HS heading as<br /> the product) may be used, subject, however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in the<br /> rule. However, the expression \"Manufacture from materials of any HS heading, including other materials of<br /> HS heading ...\" or \"Manufacture from materials of any HS heading, including other materials of the same HS<br /> heading as the product\" means that materials of any HS heading(s) may be used, except those of the same<br /> description as the product as given in column 2 of the list.<br /> 3.4. When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one material, this means<br /> that one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all be used.<br /> Example: The rule for fabrics of HS headings 5208 to 5212 provides that natural fibres may be used and<br /> that chemical materials, among other materials, may also be used. This does not mean that both have to be<br /> used; it is possible to use one or the other or both.<br /> 3.5. Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular material, the rule<br /> does not prevent the use also of other materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy this<br /> condition. (See also Note 6.2 below in relation to textiles). However, this does not apply to products which,<br /> although they cannot be manufactured from the particular material specified in the list, can be produced<br /> from a material of the same nature at an earlier stage of manufacture.<br /> Note 4<br /> 4.1. The term \"natural fibres\" is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic fibres. It is restricted<br /> to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres<br /> that have been carded, combed or otherwise processed but not spun.<br /> 4.2. The term \"natural fibres\" includes horsehair of HS heading 0503, silk of HS headings 5002 and 5003 as well<br /> as the wool fibres, fine or coarse animal hair of HS headings 5101 to 5105, the cotton fibres of HS headings<br /> 5201 to 5203 and the other vegetable fibres of HS headings 5301 to 5305.<br /> 4.3. The terms \"textile pulp\", \"chemical materials\" and \"paper-making materials\" are used in the list to describe<br /> the materials not classified in HS chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic<br /> or paper fibres or yarns.<br /> 4.4. The term \"man-made staple fibres\" is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament tow, staple fibres<br /> or waste, of HS headings 5501 to 5507.<br /> 76 Generalized System of Preferences: HANDBOOK ON THE SCHEME OF SWITZERLAND<br /> Note 5<br /> 5.1. Where for a given product in the list a reference is made to this note, the conditions set out in column 3 shall<br /> not be applied to any basic textile materials, used in the manufacture of this product, which, taken together,<br /> represent 10 per cent or less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 5.3<br /> and 5.4 below).<br /> 5.2. However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 5.1 may only be applied to mixed products which have been<br /> made from two or more basic textile materials.<br /> The following are the basic textile materials:<br /> • silk,<br /> • wool,<br /> • coarse animal hair,<br /> • fine animal hair,<br /> • horsehair,<br /> • cotton,<br /> • paper-making materials and paper,<br /> • flax,<br /> • true hemp,<br /> • jute and other textile bast fibres,<br /> • sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave,<br /> • coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,<br /> • synthetic man-made filaments,<br /> • artificial man-made filaments,<br /> • current conducting filaments,<br /> • synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene,<br /> • synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester,<br /> • synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide,<br /> • synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile,<br /> • synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide,<br /> • synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene,<br /> • synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyphenylene sulphide,<br /> • synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyvinyl chloride,<br /> • other synthetic man-made staple fibres,<br /> • artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose,<br /> • other artificial man-made staple fibres,<br /> • yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether whether or not gimped,<br /> • yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester whether or not gimped,<br /> • products of HS heading 5605 (metallized yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil<br /> or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5<br /> mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film,<br /> • other products of HS heading 5605,<br /> • glass fibres,<br /> • metallic fibres.<br /> Example: A yarn of HS heading 5205 made from cotton fibres of HS heading 5203 and synthetic staple fibres<br /> of HS heading 5506 is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres that do not satisfy the<br /> origin rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) may be used up to a weight<br /> of 10 per cent of the yarn.<br /> Example: A woollen fabric of HS heading 5112 made from woollen yarn of HS heading 5107 and synthetic<br /> yarn of staple fibres of HS heading 5509 is a mixed fabric. Therefore synthetic yarn which does not satisfy<br /> ANNEX 4: LIST OF WORKING OR PROCESSING REQUIRED TO BE CARRIED OUT ON NON-ORIGINATING<br /> MATERIALS IN ORDER THAT THE PRODUCT MANUFACTURED CAN OBTAIN ORIGINATING STATUS<br /> the origin rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) or woollen yarn that does<br /> not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from natural fibres, not carded or combed or otherwise<br /> prepared for spinning) or a combination of the two may be used provided their total weight does not exceed<br /> 10 per cent of the weight of the fabric.<br /> Example: Tufted textile fabric of HS heading 5802 made from cotton yarn of HS heading 5205 and cotton<br /> fabric of HS heading 5210 is only a mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric being made from<br /> yarns classified in two separate HS headings or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.<br /> Example: If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of HS heading 5205 and<br /> synthetic fabric of HS heading 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic textile materials<br /> and the tufted textile fabric is accordingly a mixed product.<br /> 5.3. In the case of products incorporating \"yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of<br /> polyether whether or not gimped\" this tolerance is 20 per cent in respect of this yarn.<br /> 5.4. In the case of products incorporating \"strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film<br /> whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of an<br /> adhesive between two films of plastic film\", this tolerance is 30 per cent in respect of this strip.<br /> Note 6<br /> 6.1. In the case of those textile products which are marked in the list by a footnote referring to this note, textile<br /> materials, with the exception of linings and interlinings, which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in<br /> column 3 for the made-up product concerned may be used provided that they are classified in a HS heading<br /> other than that of the product and that their value does not exceed 8 per cent of the ex-works price of the<br /> product.<br /> 6.2. Without prejudice to Note 6.3, materials which are not classified within HS chapters 50 to 63 may be used<br /> freely in the manufacture of textile products, whether or not they contain textiles.<br /> Example: If a rule in the list provides that for a particular textile item, such as trousers, yarn must be used,<br /> this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because buttons are not classified within HS<br /> chapters 50 to 63. For the same reason, it does not prevent the use of slide-fasteners even though slide-<br /> fasteners normally contain textiles.<br /> 6.3. Where a percentage rule applies, the value of materials which are not classified within HS chapters 50 to 63<br /> must be taken into account when calculating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.<br /> Note 7<br /> 7.1. For the purposes of HS headings 2707 and 2713, the \"specific processes\" are the following:<br /> (a) vacuum distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;<br /> (c) cracking;<br /> (d) reforming;<br /> (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f) the process comprising all the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum<br /> or sulphuric anhydride; neutralization with alkaline agents; decolorization and purification with naturally<br /> active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;<br /> (g) polymerization;<br /> (h) alkylation;<br /> (i) isomerization.<br /> 78 Generalized System of Preferences: HANDBOOK ON THE SCHEME OF SWITZERLAND<br /> 7.2. For the purposes of HS headings 2710 to 2712, the \"specific processes\" are the following:<br /> (a) vacuum distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;<br /> (c) cracking;<br /> (d) reforming;<br /> (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f) the process comprising all the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum<br /> or sulphuric anhydride; neutralization with alkaline agents; decolorization and purification with naturally<br /> active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;<br /> (g) polymerization;<br /> (h) alkylation;<br /> (ij) isomerization;<br /> (k) in respect of heavy oils falling within HS heading ex 2710 only, desulphurization with hydrogen resulting<br /> in a reduction of at least 85 per cent of the sulphur content of the products processed (ASTM D 1266-59<br /> T method);<br /> (l) i n respect of products falling within HS heading 2710 only, deparaffining by a process other than filtering;<br /> (m) in respect of heavy oils falling within HS heading ex 2710 only, treatment with hydrogen at a pressure of<br /> more than 20 bars and a temperature of more than 250°C with the use of a catalyst, other than to effect<br /> desulphurization, when the hydrogen constitutes an active element in a chemical reaction. The further<br /> treatment with hydrogen of lubricating oils of HS heading ex 2710 (e.g. hydrofinishing or decolorization)<br /> in order, more especially, to improve colour or stability shall not, however, be deemed to be a specific<br /> process;<br /> (n) i n respect of fuel oils falling within HS heading ex 2710 only, atmospheric distillation, on condition that<br /> less than 30 per cent of these products distils, by volume, including losses, at 300°C by the ASTM D 86<br /> method;<br /> (o) i n respect of heavy oils other than gas oils and fuel oils falling within HS heading ex 2710 only, treatment<br /> by means of a high-frequency electrical brush-discharge;<br /> (p) in respect of crude products (other than petroleum jelly, ozokerite, lignite wax or peat wax, paraffin<br /> wax containing by weight less than 0,75 % of oil) of HS heading ex 2712 only, de-oiling by fractional<br /> crystallisation.<br /> 7.3. For the purposes of HS headings ex 2707 to 2713, simple operations such as cleaning, decanting, desalting,<br /> water separation, filtering, colouring, marking, obtaining a sulphur content as a result of mixing products with<br /> different sulphur contents, any combination of these operations or like operations do not confer origin.","ShowProductAffected":false,"ProductAffected":null,"RevisionName":null,"Rank":0,"ShowRooExceptions":false,"RooExceptions":null}],"SpecificNote":[{"RooCode":null,"RooText":null,"ShowProductAffected":false,"ProductAffected":null,"RevisionName":null,"Rank":0,"ShowRooExceptions":false,"RooExceptions":null}],"Documents":[{"DocDesc":"Certificate of origin","DocFileName":"itc00692_coo.pdf","DocType":"1_coo","WebLink":"http://unctad.org/Sections/gsp/docs/gsp_form_a_new_en.pdf"},{"DocDesc":"Product-specific rules of origin","DocFileName":"itc00692_sroo.pdf","DocType":"2_sroo","WebLink":"https://www.admin.ch/opc/fr/classified-compilation/20110090/index.html#app1ahref0"},{"DocDesc":"Chapter on rules of origin","DocFileName":"itc00692_roo.pdf","DocType":"3_roo","WebLink":"https://www.admin.ch/opc/fr/classified-compilation/20110090/index.html"},{"DocDesc":"WTO notification","DocFileName":"itc00692_wto.pdf","DocType":"9_wto","WebLink":"http://docsonline.wto.org/imrd/gen_redirectsearchdirect.asp?RN=0&searchtype=browse&query=@meta_Symbol%22G/RO/LDC/N/CHE/1%22&language=1&ct=DDFEnglish"}]},"FtaProvisions":{"RooProvision":[{"ProvisionAbbrev":"accum","ProvisionCode":"Cumulation","ProvisionValue":"cross-cumulation","ProvisionRank":null,"ProvisionGlossary":"A provision which allows to consider goods obtained in as well as processing taking place in one FTA member country as originating in another.","ProvisionGlossaryLink":"/en/glossary?uid=accum&returnto=gloscenter","ProvisionLegalExtract":"Art. 4 Origin criteria <br /> 1 Products are considered to be products originating in a beneficiary country if they <br /> are: <br /> a. wholly obtained or manufactured; <br /> b. obtained incorporating materials which have not been wholly obtained there, <br /> provided that such materials have undergone sufficient working or pro- <br /> cessing within the meaning of Article 6. <br /> 2 Products originating in Switzerland are considered to be products originating in a <br /> beneficiary country if they have undergone working or processing in that country <br /> going beyond the minimal operations mentioned in Article 7. <br /> 3 As products originating in Switzerland are considered products which are either <br /> wholly obtained or produced or sufficiently worked or processed in Switzerland in <br /> accordance with paragraph 1.4 In so far as the EU11, Norway and Turkey apply <br /> provisions for granting preferential tariffs for developing countries which corre- <br /> spond to the provisions of this Ordinance, originating products of chapters 25-97 of <br /> the Harmonised System of the EU12, Norway13 and Turkey are considered to be <br /> products originating in a beneficiary country if they have undergone working or <br /> processing going beyond the minimal operations mentioned in Article 7 in this <br /> country. 5 Paragraph 4 applies only to products originating in the EU, Norway or <br /> Turkey which are imported unchanged into the beneficiary country; Article 19 <br /> applies mutatis mutandis.14 <br /> 10 SR 0.632.11 <br /> 11 Term in accordance with No I of the Ordinance of 23 Nov. 2016, in force since 1 Jan. <br /> 2017 (AS 2016 4959).

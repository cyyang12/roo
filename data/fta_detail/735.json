There are four different types of rule, which vary according to<br /> the product:<br /> (a) through working or processing a maximum content of non-originating materials is not<br /> exceeded;<br /> (b) through working or processing the 4-digit Harmonized System heading or 6-digit<br /> Harmonized System sub-heading of the manufactured products becomes different from<br /> the 4-digit Harmonized System heading or 6-digit sub-heading respectively of the<br /> materials used;<br /> (c) a specific working and processing operation is carried out;<br /> (d) working or processing is carried out on certain wholly obtained materials.<br /> Note 2 \u2014 The structure of the list<br /> 2.1 Columns 1 and 2 describe the product obtained. Column 1 gives the chapter number,<br /> 4-digit heading or 6-digit sub-heading number used in the Harmonized System, as<br /> appropriate. Column 2 gives the description of goods used in that system for that heading or<br /> chapter. For each entry in columns 1 and 2, subject to Note<br /> (\"qualifying operations\") are set out in column 3. These qualifying operations concern only<br /> non-originating materials. Where, in some cases, the entry in column 1 is preceded by \"ex\",<br /> this signifies that the rule in column 3 applies only to the part of that heading as described in<br /> column 2.<br /> 2.2 Where several Harmonized System headings or sub-headings are grouped together in<br /> column 1 or a chapter number is given and the description of products in column 2 is<br /> therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rule in column 3 applies to all products which,<br /> under the Harmonized System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in any of the<br /> headings or sub-headings grouped together in column 1.<br /> 2.3 Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a<br /> heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the<br /> adjacent rule in column 3.<br /> 2.4 Where two alternative rules are set out in column 3, separated by \"or\", it is at the<br /> choice of the exporter which one to use.<br /> Note 3 \u2014 General provisions concerning certain agricultural goods<br /> 3.1 Agricultural goods falling within Chapters 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and heading 2401 which are<br /> grown or harvested in the territory of a beneficiary country shall be treated as originating in<br /> the territory of that country, even if grown from seeds, bulbs, rootstock, cuttings, grafts,<br /> shoots, buds, or other live parts of plants imported from another country.<br /> 3.2 In cases where the content of non originating sugar in a given product is subject to<br /> limitations, the weight of sugars of headings 1701 (sucrose) and 1702 (e.g., fructose, glucose,<br /> lactose, maltose, isoglucose or invert sugar) used in the manufacture of the final product and<br /> used in the manufacture of the non-originating products incorporated in the final product is<br /> taken into account for the calculation of such limitations.<br /> Note 4 \u2014 Terminology used in respect of certain textile products<br /> 4.1 The term \"natural fibres\" is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or<br /> synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and,<br /> unless otherwise specified, includes fibres which have been carded, combed or otherwise<br /> processed, but not spun.<br /> 4.2 The term \"natural fibres\" includes horsehair of heading 0503, silk of headings 5002<br /> and 5003, as well as wool-fibres and fine or coarse animal hair of headings 5101 to 5105,<br /> cotton fibres of headings 5201 to 5203, and other vegetable fibres of headings 5301 to 5305.<br /> 4.3 The terms \"textile pulp\", \"chemical materials\" and \"paper-making materials\" are used<br /> in the list to describe the materials, not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to<br /> manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.<br /> 4.4 The term \"man-made staple fibres\" is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial<br /> filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of headings 5501 to 5507.<br /> Note 5 \u2014 Tolerances applicable to products made of a mixture of textile materials<br /> 5.1 Where, for a given product in the list, reference is made to this Note, the conditions<br /> set out in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials used in the manufacture<br /> of this product and which, taken together, represent 10 % or less of the total weight of all the<br /> basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 5.3 and 5.4)<br /> 5.2 However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 6.1 may be applied only to mixed products<br /> which have been made from two or more basic textile materials.<br /> The following are the basic textile materials:<br /> - silk,<br /> - wool,<br /> - coarse animal hair,<br /> - fine animal hair,<br /> - horsehair,<br /> - cotton,<br /> - paper-making materials and paper,<br /> - flax,<br /> - true hemp,<br /> - jute and other textile bast fibres,<br /> - sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave,<br /> - coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,<br /> - synthetic man-made filaments,<br /> - artificial man-made filaments,<br /> - current-conducting filaments,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(phenylene sulphide),<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(vinyl chloride),<br /> - other synthetic man-made staple fibres,<br /> - artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose,<br /> - other artificial man-made staple fibres,<br /> - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or<br /> not gimped,<br /> - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester, whether or not<br /> gimped,<br /> - products of heading 5605 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core of<br /> aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder,<br /> of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured<br /> adhesive between two layers of plastic film,<br /> - other products of heading 5605,<br /> - glass fibres,<br /> - metal fibres.<br /> Example:<br /> A yarn, of heading 5205, made from cotton fibres of heading 5203 and synthetic staple fibres<br /> of heading 5506, is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres which do<br /> not satisfy the origin rules may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10 %<br /> of the weight of the yarn.<br /> Example:<br /> A woollen fabric, of heading 5112, made from woollen yarn of heading 5107 and synthetic<br /> yarn of staple fibres of heading 5509, is a mixed fabric. Therefore, synthetic yarn which does<br /> not satisfy the origin rules, or woollen yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules, or a<br /> combination of the two, may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10 %<br /> of the weight of the fabric.<br /> Example:<br /> Tufted textile fabric, of heading 5802, made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and cotton<br /> fabric of heading 5210, is only a mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric<br /> made from yarns classified in two separate headings, or if the cotton yarns used are<br /> themselves mixtures.<br /> Example:<br /> If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and<br /> synthetic fabric of heading 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic<br /> textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is, accordingly, a mixed product.<br /> 5.3 In the case of products incorporating \"yarn made of polyurethane segmented with<br /> flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped\", the tolerance is 20 % in respect of<br /> this yarn.<br /> 5.3 In the case of products incorporating \"strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or<br /> of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not<br /> exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two<br /> layers of plastic film\", the tolerance is 30 % in respect of this strip.<br /> Note 6 \u2014 Other tolerances applicable to certain textile products<br /> 6.1 Where, in the list, reference is made to this Note, textile materials which do not satisfy<br /> the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the made-up product concerned, may be used,<br /> provided that they are classified in a heading other than that of the product and that their<br /> value does not exceed 8 % of the ex-works price of the product.<br /> 6.2 Materials, which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63, may be used freely in the<br /> manufacture of textile products, whether or not they contain textiles.<br /> Example:<br /> If a rule in the list provides that, for a particular textile item (such as trousers), yarn must be<br /> used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because buttons are not<br /> classified within Chapters 50 to 63. For the same reason, it does not prevent the use of slide-<br /> fasteners, even though slide-fasteners normally contain textiles.<br /> 6.3. Where a percentage-rule applies, the value of materials which are not classified within<br /> Chapters 50 to 63 must be taken into account when calculating the value of the non-<br /> originating materials incorporated.<br /> Note 7 \u2014 Definition of specific processes and simple operations carried out in respect of<br /> certain products of Chapter 27<br /> 7.1. For the purposes of headings ex 2707 and 2713, the \"specific processes\" are the<br /> following:<br /> (a) vacuum-distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation-process (1);<br /> (c) cracking;<br /> (d) reforming;<br /> (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f) the process comprising all of the following operations: processing with concentrated<br /> sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents;<br /> decolourisation and purification with naturally-active earth, activated earth, activated<br /> charcoal or bauxite;<br /> (g) polymerisation;<br /> (h) alkylation;<br /> (i) isomerisation.<br /> 7.2. For the purposes of headings 2710, 2711 and 2712, the \"specific processes\" are the<br /> following:<br /> (a) vacuum-distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation-process (1);<br /> (c) cracking;<br /> (d) reforming;<br /> (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f) the process comprising all of the following operations: processing with concentrated<br /> sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents;<br /> decolourisation and purification with naturally-active earth, activated earth, activated<br /> charcoal or bauxite;<br /> (g) polymerisation;<br /> (h) alkylation;<br /> (i) isomerisation;<br /> (j) in respect of heavy oils of heading ex 2710 only, desulphurisation with hydrogen,<br /> resulting in a reduction of at least 85 % of the sulphur-content of the products processed<br /> (ASTM D 1266-59 T method);<br /> (k) in respect of products of heading 2710 only, deparaffining by a process other than<br /> filtering;<br /> (l) in respect of heavy oils of heading ex 2710 only, treatment with hydrogen, at a pressure<br /> of more than 20 bar and a temperature of more than 250 \u00b0C, with the use of a catalyst,<br /> other than to effect desulphurisation, when the hydrogen constitutes an active element in a<br /> chemical reaction. The further treatment, with hydrogen, of lubricating oils of heading ex<br /> 2710 (e.g. hydrofinishing or decolourisation), in order, more especially, to improve colour<br /> or stability shall not, however, be deemed to be a specific process;<br /> (m) in respect of fuel oils of heading ex 2710 only, atmospheric distillation, on condition that<br /> less than 30 % of these products distils, by volume, including losses, at 300 \u00b0C, by the<br /> ASTM D 86 method;<br /> (n) in respect of heavy oils other than gas oils and fuel oils of heading ex 2710 only,<br /> treatment by means of a high-frequency electrical brush-discharge.<br /> (o) in respect of crude products (other than petroleum jelly, ozokerite, lignite wax or peat<br /> wax, paraffin wax containing by weight less than 0,75 % of oil) of heading ex 2712 only,<br /> de-oiling by fractional crystallisation.<br /> 7.3. For the purposes of headings ex 2707 and 2713, simple operations, such as cleaning,<br /> decanting, desalting, water-separation, filtering, colouring, marking, obtaining a sulphur-<br /> content as a result of mixing products with different sulphur-contents, or any combination of<br /> these operations or like operations, do not confer origin.", "ShowProductAffected": false, "ProductAffected": null, "RevisionName": null, "Rank": 0, "ShowRooExceptions": false, "RooExceptions": null}], "SpecificNote": [{"RooCode": null, "RooText": null, "ShowProductAffected": false, "ProductAffected": null, "RevisionName": null, "Rank": 0, "ShowRooExceptions": false, "RooExceptions": null}], "Documents": [{"DocDesc": "Certificate of origin", "DocFileName": "itc00757_coo.pdf", "DocType": "1_coo", "WebLink": null}, {"DocDesc": "Product-specific rules of origin", "DocFileName": "itc00757_sroo.pdf", "DocType": "2_sroo", "WebLink": null}, {"DocDesc": "Chapter on rules of origin", "DocFileName": "itc00757_roo.pdf", "DocType": "3_roo", "WebLink": null}, {"DocDesc": "Full text of agreement", "DocFileName": "itc00757_full.pdf", "DocType": "8_full", "WebLink": "http://www.mek.gov.me/ResourceManager/FileDownload.aspx?rId=156650&rType=2"}, {"DocDesc": "WTO notification", "DocFileName": "itc00757_wto.pdf", "DocType": "9_wto", "WebLink": "https://docs.wto.org/dol2fe/Pages/SS/directdoc.aspx?filename=q:/G/RO/N98.pdf"}]}, "FtaProvisions": {"RooProvision": [{"ProvisionAbbrev": "accum", "ProvisionCode": "Cumulation", "ProvisionValue": "bilateral", "ProvisionRank": null, "ProvisionGlossary": "A provision which allows to consider goods obtained in as well as processing taking place in one FTA member country as originating in another.", "ProvisionGlossaryLink": "/en/glossary?uid=accum&returnto=gloscenter", "ProvisionLegalExtract": "Article 3 : Cumulation in Montenegro <br /> Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 2(1), products shall be considered as <br /> originating in Montenegro if such products are obtained there, incorporating materials <br /> originating in Ukraine, provided that the working or processing carried out in Montenegro <br /> goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 7.

The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column gives the heading number or chapter<br /> number used in the Harmonized System and the second column gives the description of goods used in that system for<br /> that heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns a rule is specified in column 3 or 4. Where, in some<br /> cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an \u2018ex', this signifies that the rules in column 3 or 4 apply only to the<br /> part of that heading as described in column 2.<br /> 2. Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number is given and the description of<br /> products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rules in column 3 or 4 apply to all products which,<br /> under the Harmonized System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in any of the headings grouped together in<br /> column 1.<br /> 3. Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each indent contains the<br /> description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rules in column 3 or 4.<br /> 4. Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both column 3 and 4, the exporter may opt, as an<br /> alternative, to apply either the rule set out in column 3 or that set out in column 4. If no origin rule is given in column<br /> 4, the rule set out in column 3 has to be applied.<br /> Note 3:<br /> 1. The provisions of Article 6 of the Protocol concerning products having acquired originating status which are used in the<br /> manufacture of other products apply regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where these<br /> products are used or in another factory in the European Community or in the Pacific States.<br /> Example:<br /> An engine of heading No 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-originating materials which may be<br /> incorporated may not exceed 40 per cent of the ex-works price, is made from \u2018other alloy steel roughly shaped by forg\u00ad<br /> ing' of heading No ex 7224.<br /> If this forging has been forged in the European Community from a non-originating ingot, it has already acquired origi\u00ad<br /> nating status by virtue of the rule for heading No ex 7224 in the list. The forging can then count as originating in the<br /> value calculation for the engine regardless of whether it was produced in the same factory or in another factory in the<br /> European Community. The value of the non-originating ingot is thus not taken into account when adding up the value<br /> of the non-originating materials used.<br /> 2. The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing required and the carrying out of more<br /> working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the carrying out of less working or processing cannot<br /> confer originating status. Therefore, if a rule provides that non-originating material at a certain level of manufacture may<br /> be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed and the use of such material at a later stage<br /> is not.<br /> 3. Without prejudice to Note 3.2 where a rule states that \u2018materials of any heading' may be used, materials of the same<br /> heading as the product may also be used, subject, however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in<br /> the rule. However, the expression \u2018manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of heading<br /> No \u2026' means that only materials classified in the same heading as the product of a different description than that of the<br /> product as given in column 2 of the list may be used.<br /> 4 When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one material, this means that any<br /> one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all of those materials be used.<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for fabrics of heading Nos 5208 to 5212 provides that natural fibres may be used and that chemical materials<br /> among other materials may also be used. This does not mean that both have to be used; it is possible to use one or the<br /> other or both.<br /> 5 Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular material, the condition obvi\u00ad<br /> ously does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule. (See<br /> also Note 6.3 below in relation to textiles).<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for prepared foods of heading No 1904 which specifically excludes the use of cereals and their derivatives does<br /> not prevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and other additives which are not products from cereals.<br /> However, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be manufactured from the particular materials<br /> specified in the list, can be produced from a material of the same nature at an earlier stage of manufacture.<br /> Example:<br /> In the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 made from non-woven materials, if the use of only non-originating<br /> yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is not possible to start from non-woven cloth \u2014 even if non-woven cloths can\u00ad<br /> not normally be made from yarn. In such cases, the starting material would normally be at the stage before yarn \u2014 that<br /> is the fibre stage.<br /> 6 Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of non-originating materials that can be<br /> used, then these percentages may not be added together. In other words, the maximum value of all the non-originating<br /> materials used may never exceed the highest of the percentages given. Furthermore, the individual percentages must not<br /> be exceeded in relation to the particular materials they apply to.<br /> Note 4:<br /> 1. The term \u2018natural fibres' is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the<br /> stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres that have been carded,<br /> combed or otherwise processed but not spun.<br /> 2. The term \u2018natural fibres' includes horsehair of heading No 0503, silk of heading Nos 5002 and 5003 as well as the wool<br /> fibres, fine or coarse animal hair of heading Nos 5101 to 5105, the cotton fibres of heading Nos 5201 to 5203 and the<br /> other vegetable fibres of heading Nos 5301 to 5305.<br /> 3. The terms \u2018textile pulp', \u2018chemical materials' and \u2018paper-making materials' are used in the list to describe the materials<br /> not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.<br /> 4. The term \u2018man-made staple fibres' is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste,<br /> of heading Nos 5501 to 5507.<br /> Note 5:<br /> 1. Where for a given product in the list a reference is made to this note, the conditions set out in column 3 shall not be<br /> applied to any basic textile materials, used in the manufacture of this product, which, taken together, represent 10 per<br /> cent or less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 5.3 and 5.4 below).<br /> 2. However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 5.1 may only be applied to mixed products which have been made from two<br /> or more basic textile materials.<br /> The following are the basic textile materials:<br /> \u2014 silk,<br /> \u2014 wool,<br /> \u2014 coarse animal hair,<br /> \u2014 fine animal hair,<br /> \u2014 horsehair,<br /> \u2014 cotton,<br /> \u2014 paper-making materials and paper,<br /> \u2014 flax,<br /> \u2014 true hemp,<br /> \u2014 jute and other textile bast fibres,<br /> \u2014 sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave,<br /> \u2014 coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made filaments,<br /> \u2014 artificial man-made filaments,<br /> \u2014 current conducting filaments,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyphenylene sulphide,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyvinyl chloride,<br /> \u2014 other synthetic man-made staple fibres,<br /> \u2014 artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose,<br /> \u2014 other artificial man-made staple fibres,<br /> \u2014 yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether whether or not gimped,<br /> \u2014 yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester whether or not gimped,<br /> \u2014 products of heading No 5605 (metallized yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a<br /> core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by<br /> means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film,<br /> \u2014 other products of heading No 5605.<br /> Example:<br /> A yarn of heading No 5205 made from cotton fibres of heading No 5203 and synthetic staple fibres of heading No 5506<br /> is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres that do not satisfy the origin rules (which require<br /> manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) may be used up to a weight of 10 per cent of the yarn.<br /> Example:<br /> A woollen fabric of heading No 5112 made from woollen yarn of heading No 5107 and synthetic yarn of staple fibres<br /> of heading No 5509 is a mixed fabric. Therefore synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules (which require<br /> manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) or woollen yarn that does not satisfy the origin rules (which require<br /> manufacture from natural fibres, not carded or combed or otherwise prepared for spinning) or a combination of the<br /> two may be used provided their total weight does not exceed 10 per cent of the weight of the fabric.<br /> Example:<br /> Tufted textile fabric of heading No 5802 made from cotton yarn of heading No 5205 and cotton fabric of heading<br /> No 5210 is only a mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric being made from yarns classified in two<br /> separate headings or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.<br /> Example:<br /> If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading No 5205 and synthetic fabric of head\u00ad<br /> ing No 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is accord\u00ad<br /> ingly a mixed product.<br /> 3 In the case of products incorporating \u2018yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether whether<br /> or not gimped' this tolerance is 20 per cent in respect of this yarn.<br /> 4 In the case of products incorporating \u2018strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or<br /> not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of an adhesive between two<br /> layers of plastic film', this tolerance is 30 per cent in respect of this strip.<br /> Note 6:<br /> 1. In the case of those textile products, which are marked in the list by a footnote referring to this Introductory Note, tex\u00ad<br /> tile trimmings and accessories which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the made up products<br /> concerned may be used provided that their weight does not exceed 10 % of the total weight of all the textile materials<br /> incorporated.<br /> Textile trimmings and accessories are those classified in Chapters 50 to 63. Linings and interlinings are not be regarded<br /> as trimmings or accessories.<br /> 2. Any non-textile trimmings and accessories or other materials used which contain textiles do not have to satisfy the con\u00ad<br /> ditions set out in column 3 even though they fall outside the scope of Note 3.5.<br /> 3. In accordance with Note 3.5, any non-originating non-textile trimmings and accessories or other product, which do not<br /> contain any textiles, may, anyway, be used freely where they cannot be made from the materials listed in column 3.<br /> For example (1), if a rule in the list says that for a particular textile item, such as a blouse, yarn must be used, this does<br /> not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because they cannot be made from textile materials.<br /> 4. Where a percentage rule applies, the value of trimmings and accessories must be taken into account when calculating<br /> the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.<br /> Note 7:<br /> 1. For the purposes of heading Nos ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex 3403, the \u2018specific processes' are the<br /> following:<br /> (a) vacuum distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process<br /> (1) This example is given for the purpose of explanation only.

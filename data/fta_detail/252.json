<br /> opening inventory means the materials inventory at the time an inventory management <br /> method is chosen; and <br /> origin identifier means any mark that identifies fungible materials as originating <br /> materials or non-originating materials. <br /> Subsection 2: General <br /> 1 The inventory management methods for determining whether fungible materials <br /> referred to in Article IV.5(a) are originating materials are the following: <br /> (a) specific identification method;

and <br /> (ii) the total units of originating materials and non-originating materials that <br /> are fungible materials and that were received in materials inventory <br /> during that preceding one-month or three-month period. <br /> 3 The ratio calculated with respect to a preceding one-month or three-month period <br /> under paragraph 2 is applied to the fungible materials remaining in materials inventory at <br /> the end of the preceding one-month or three-month period. <br /> 4 Where the good is subject to a regional value-content requirement and the regional <br /> value content of that good is calculated under the transaction value method or the net cost <br /> method, the ratio is calculated with respect to each shipment of the good by dividing: <br /> (a) the total units of originating materials or non-originating materials that are <br /> fungible materials and that were in materials inventory prior to the shipment; by: <br /> (b) the total units of originating materials and non-originating materials that are <br /> fungible materials and that were in materials inventory prior to the shipment. <br /> 5 The ratio calculated with respect to a shipment of a good under paragraph 4 is <br /> applied to the fungible materials remaining in materials inventory after the shipment. <br /> Subsection 5: Manner of Dealing with Opening Inventory <br /> 1 Except as otherwise provided under paragraphs 2 and 3, where the producer or <br /> person referred to in Subsection 2.2 has fungible materials in opening inventory, the <br /> origin of those fungible materials is determined by: <br /> (a) identifying, in the books of the producer or person, the latest receipts of <br /> fungible materials that add up to the amount of fungible materials in opening inventory; <br /> (b) determining the origin of the fungible materials that make up those receipts; and <br /> (c) considering the origin of those fungible materials to be the origin of the <br /> fungible materials in opening inventory. <br /> 2. Where the producer or person chooses the specific identification method and has, in <br /> opening inventory, originating materials or non-originating materials that are fungible <br /> materials and that are marked with an origin identifier, the origin of those fungible <br /> materials is determined on the basis of the origin identifier. <br /> 3. The producer or person may consider all fungible materials in opening inventory to be <br /> non-originating materials. <br /> Section II: Fungible Goods <br /> Subsection 6: Definitions and Interpretation <br /> For purposes of this Section: <br /> average method means the method by which the origin of fungible goods withdrawn <br /> from finished goods inventory is based on the ratio, calculated under Section 9, of <br /> originating goods and non-originating goods in finished goods inventory; <br /> FIFO method means the method by which the origin of fungible goods first received in <br /> finished goods inventory is considered to be the origin of fungible goods first withdrawn <br /> from finished goods inventory; <br /> finished goods inventory means an inventory from which fungible goods are sold or <br /> otherwise transferred to another person; <br /> LIFO method means the method by which the origin of fungible goods last received in <br /> finished goods inventory is considered to be the origin of fungible goods first withdrawn <br /> from finished goods inventory; <br /> opening inventory means the finished goods inventory at the time an inventory <br /> management method is chosen; and <br /> origin identifier means any mark that identifies fungible goods as originating goods or <br /> non-originating goods. <br /> Subsection 7: General <br /> 1 The inventory management methods for determining whether fungible goods <br /> referred to in Article IV.5(b) are originating goods are the following: <br /> (a) specific identification method; <br /> (b) FIFO method; <br /> (c) LIFO method; and <br /> (d) average method. <br /> 2 Where an exporter of a good or a person from whom the exporter acquired the good <br /> chooses an inventory management method referred to in paragraph 1, that method, <br /> including the averaging period chosen in the case of the averaging method, shall be used <br /> from the time the choice is made until the end of the fiscal year of the exporter or person. <br /> Subsection 8: Specific Identification Method <br /> 1 Except as provided under paragraph 2, where the exporter or person referred to in <br /> Subsection 7.2 chooses the specific identification method, the exporter or person shall <br /> physically segregate, in finished goods inventory, originating goods that are fungible <br /> goods from non-originating goods that are fungible goods. <br /> 2 Where originating goods or non-originating goods that are fungible goods are <br /> marked with an origin identifier, the exporter or person need not physically segregate <br /> those goods under paragraph 1 if the origin identifier is visible on the fungible goods. <br /> Subsection 9: Average Method <br /> 1 Where the exporter or person referred to in Subsection 7.2 chooses the average <br /> method, the origin of each shipment of fungible goods withdrawn from finished goods <br /> inventory during a one-month or three-month period, at the choice of the exporter or <br /> person, is determined on the basis of the ratio of originating goods and non-originating <br /> goods in finished goods inventory for the preceding one-month or three-month period <br /> that is calculated by dividing: <br /> (a) the sum of: <br /> (i) the total units of originating goods or non-originating goods that are <br /> fungible goods and that were in finished goods inventory at the <br /> beginning of the preceding one-month or three-month period; and <br /> (ii) the total units of originating or non-originating goods that are fungible <br /> goods and that were received in finished goods inventory during that <br /> preceding one-month or three-month period. <br /> by: <br /> (b) the sum of: <br /> (i) the total units of originating goods and non-originating goods that are <br /> fungible goods and that were in finished goods inventory at the <br /> beginning of the preceding one-month or three-month period; and <br /> (ii) the total units of originating goods and non-originating goods that are <br /> fungible goods and that were received in finished goods inventory <br /> during that preceding one-month or three-month period. <br /> 2 The ratio calculated with respect to a preceding month or three-month period under <br /> paragraph 1 is applied to the fungible goods remaining in finished goods inventory at the <br /> end of the preceding month or three-month period. <br /> Subsection 10: Manner of Dealing with Opening Inventory <br /> 1 Except as otherwise provided under paragraphs 2 and 3, where the exporter or <br /> person referred to in Subsection 7.2 has fungible goods in opening inventory, the origin <br /> of those fungible goods is determined by: <br /> (a) identifying, in the books of the exporter or person, the latest receipts of <br /> fungible goods that add up to the amount of fungible goods in opening inventory; <br /> (b) determining the origin of those fungible goods that make up those receipts; and <br /> (c) considering the origin of those fungible goods to be the origin of the fungible <br /> goods in opening inventory. <br /> 2 Where the exporter or person chooses the specific identification method and has, in <br /> opening inventory, originating goods or non-originating goods that are fungible goods <br /> and that are marked with an origin identifier, the origin of those fungible goods is <br /> determined on the basis of the origin identifier. <br /> 3 The exporter or person may consider all fungible goods in opening inventory to be <br /> non-originating goods.", "ProvisionValueCssClass": "", "ProvisionDisplayCssClass": null}, {"ProvisionAbbrev": "sets", "ProvisionCode": "Sets", "ProvisionValue": "included (RVC 50%)", "ProvisionRank": null, "ProvisionGlossary": "A provision that clarifies circumstances under which sets can be considered originating.

serial number, printed or otherwise, or, where there is no serial <br /> number, a reference to the commercial invoice by which it can be identified does <br /> not need to be stamped and signed by an authority designated by the beneficiary <br /> country, so does not need to be an original <br /> Box 1 <br /> Enter the full name and business address of the exporter. <br /> Box 2 Consignee <br /> The completion of this box is optional, but you are recommended to enter the <br /> name and address of the consignee where this is known. For exports to <br /> exhibitions which are later sent on to the UK, insert also the name and address of <br /> the exhibition. <br /> Box 3 Transport details <br /> You should complete this box on the basis of available information. If you do not <br /> have details of the transport arrangements, then leave this box blank. <br /> Box 4 For official use <br /> This box is reserved for the use of the certifying authority. However, if the Form A <br /> has been made out after the goods have been shipped, stamp or write @^@Issued <br /> Retrospectively@^@. <br /> Box 5 Item number <br /> If different types of goods are shown separately on the invoice(s), show each <br /> type separately on the Form A and itemise them (1, 2, 3 etc), so they can be <br /> cross-checked to the invoice if necessary. <br /> Box 6 Marks and numbers <br /> Enter the identifying marks and numbers that appear on the packages. If the <br /> packages are marked with the address of the consignee, state the address. If <br /> they are not marked in any way, put 'No marks and numbers'. If both originating <br /> and non-originating goods are packed together, add 'Part contents only' at the <br /> end of each entry. <br /> Box 7 Number and kind of packages, description of goods <br /> Bulk Goods <br /> Identify the goods by giving a reasonably full commercial description e.g. <br /> 'photocopiers' or 'typewriters' rather than 'office machinery'. However, if the <br /> invoices give full identifying details (which need not necessarily include details of <br /> the marks and numbers of the packages) only a general description is needed. <br /> For goods in bulk which are not individually packed, insert 'In bulk'. The quantity <br /> shown must be the same as, or relatable to, the quantity shown on the invoice for <br /> the goods (e.g. if the invoice shows 100 cartons and these are loaded on to 10 <br /> pallets, specify '100 cartons' NOT '10 pallets'). <br /> Mixed consignments <br /> For consignments containing both originating and non-originating goods, describe <br /> only the originating goods on the Form A. You may be unable to avoid showing <br /> originating and non- originating goods on the same invoice. In this case, mark the <br /> invoice (for example, with an asterisk) to show which goods are non-originating <br /> and put an appropriate statement in Box 7 immediately below the description of <br /> the goods, e.g. 'Goods marked * on the invoice are non-originating and are not <br /> covered by this Form A'. The same considerations will apply if you have a mixed <br /> consignment of goods qualifying by virtue of a derogation and others which are <br /> not covered by that derogation. <br /> Unused space <br /> Draw a horizontal line under the final item in this box and rule through the unused <br /> space with a 'Z-shaped' line. <br /> Box 8 Origin criterion <br /> This box signifies to HMRC which origin rule has been applied to the goods. <br /> As described in the note about it on the reverse of the Form A, enter the code: <br /> \u2022 @^@P@^@ for wholly obtained goods and <br /> \u2022 @^@W@^@, followed by the heading, where the goods have been sufficiently <br /> processed <br /> For example: for wholly obtained goods of, say, heading 96.18, the indication <br /> should read: @^@P@^@ and for sufficiently processed goods of the same heading, it <br /> should read: @^@W@^@ 96.18. <br /> Failure to complete this box correctly could lead to the rejection of the Form A. <br /> Box 9 Gross weight or other quantity <br /> Insert the quantity in metric units (e.g. kilograms, litres etc). <br /> Box 10 Number and date of invoice <br /> You are recommended to enter the details of the commercial invoice as this <br /> ensures the signatory has verified the ex-works price. <br /> Box 11 Certification <br /> This field may be left blank. As of 1 January 2021, the UK no longer requires the <br /> Form A to be certified by a designated authority in the exporting GSP country. <br /> Box 12 Declaration by the exporter <br /> Complete this box by inserting the name of the country in which the goods are <br /> considered to have originated. You should take into account that where the <br /> provisions for regional cumulation have been applied, that country may not be the <br /> same as the country of final processing or the country of exportation. For the <br /> importing country you must put 'United Kingdom'. Indicating a different donor <br /> country (e.g. Canada) could lead to the Form A not being accepted. Only the <br /> exporter, or a person duly authorised by the exporter, can sign this declaration. <br /> Forwarding agents acting simply in that capacity are not exporters and must not <br /> sign this box. By signing this form, you declare that the goods qualify under the <br /> provisions of the Trade Preference Scheme (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 and the <br /> Customs (Origin of Chargeable Goods: Trade Preference Scheme) (EU Exit) <br /> Regulations 2020. If the declaration is incorrect, you will have committed an <br /> offence which may incur penalties. <br /> Annex B <br /> Making out a statement on origin <br /> A statement on origin (including a replacement statement on origin) must: <br /> \u2022 be made out on an invoice or any other commercial document that <br /> describes the goods in sufficient detail to enable them to be identified <br /> \u2022 include the following data elements: <br /> 1. exporter's name and business address <br /> 2. date of direct shipment to the UK <br /> 3. other references, e.g. purchase order no. <br /> 4. consignee's name and business <br /> 5. purchaser's name and address (if not the consignee) <br /> 6. country of transhipment <br /> 7. country of origin of the goods.

this box is optional, but you are recommended to enter the <br> name and address of the consignee where this is known. For exports to <br> exhibitions which are later sent on to the UK, insert also the name and address of <br> the exhibition. <br> Box 3 Transport details <br> You should complete this box on the basis of available information. If you do not <br> have details of the transport arrangements, then leave this box blank. <br> Box 4 For official use <br> This box is reserved for the use of the certifying authority.

However, if the <br> invoices give full identifying details (which need not necessarily include details of <br> the marks and numbers of the packages) only a general description is needed. <br> For goods in bulk which are not individually packed, insert 'In bulk'. The quantity <br> shown must be the same as, or relatable to, the quantity shown on the invoice for <br> the goods (e.g. if the invoice shows 100 cartons and these are loaded on to 10 <br> pallets, specify '100 cartons' NOT '10 pallets'). <br> Mixed consignments <br> For consignments containing both originating and non-originating goods, describe <br> only the originating goods on the Form A.

You should take into account that where the <br> provisions for regional cumulation have been applied, that country may not be the <br> same as the country of final processing or the country of exportation. For the <br> importing country you must put 'United Kingdom'. Indicating a different donor <br> country (e.g. Canada) could lead to the Form A not being accepted.

The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column gives the<br /> heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonized System and the second column<br /> gives the description of goods used in that system for that heading or chapter. For each entry<br /> in the first two columns a rule is specified in columns 3 or 4. Where, in some cases, the entry<br /> in the first column is preceded by an 'ex`, this signifies that the rules in columns 3 or 4 apply<br /> only to the part of that heading as described in column 2.<br /> 2.2. Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number is<br /> given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the<br /> adjacent rules in columns 3 or 4 apply to all products which, under the Harmonized System,<br /> are classified in headings of the chapter or in any of the headings grouped together in column<br /> 1<br /> 2.3. Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading,<br /> each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rules<br /> in columns 3 or 4.<br /> 2.4. Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns 3 and 4,<br /> the exporter may opt, as an alternative, to apply either the rule set out in column 3 or that set<br /> out in column 4. If no origin rule is given in column 4, the rule set out in column 3 has to be<br /> applied.<br /> Note 3:<br /> 3.1. The provisions of Article 5 of the Protocol concerning products having acquired<br /> originating status which are used in the manufacture of other products apply regardless of<br /> whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where these products are used or in<br /> another factory in Turkey or in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.<br /> Example:<br /> An engine of heading No 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-originating<br /> materials which may be incorporated may not exceed 40 per cent of the ex-works price, is<br /> made  from  'other  alloy  steel  roughly  shaped  by  forging`  of  heading  No  ex<br /> If this forging has been forged in Turkey from a non-originating ingot, it has already acquired<br /> originating status by virtue of the rule for heading No ex 7224 in the list. The forging can then<br /> count as originating in the value calculation for the engine regardless of whether it was<br /> produced in the same factory or in another factory in Turkey. The value of the non-originating<br /> ingot is thus not taken into account when adding up the value of the non-originating materials<br /> used.<br /> 3.2. The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing required and<br /> the carrying out of more working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the<br /> carrying out of less working or processing cannot confer originating status. Thus if a rule<br /> provides that non-originating material at a certain level of manufacture may be used, the use<br /> of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed and the use of such material at a<br /> later stage is not.<br /> 3.3. Without prejudice to Note 3.2 where a rule states that 'materials of any heading` may be<br /> used, materials of the same heading as the product may also be used, subject, however, to any<br /> specific limitations which may also be contained in the rule. However, the expression<br /> manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of heading No . . .`<br /> means that only materials classified in the same heading as the product of a different<br /> description than that of the product as given in column 2 of the list may be used.<br /> 3.4. When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one<br /> material, this means that any one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all be<br /> used.<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for fabrics of heading Nos 5208 to 5212 provides that natural fibres may be used and<br /> that chemical materials, among other materials, may also be used. This does not mean that<br /> both have to be used; it is possible to use one or the other or both.<br /> 3.5. Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular<br /> material, the condition obviously does not prevent the use of other materials which, because<br /> of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule. (See also Note 6.2 below in relation to<br /> textiles).<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for prepared foods of heading No 1904 which specifically excludes the use of cereals<br /> and their derivatives does not prevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and other additives<br /> which are not products from cereals.<br /> However, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be manufactured from<br /> the particular materials specified in the list, can be produced from a material of the same<br /> nature at an earlier stage of manufacture.<br /> Example:<br /> In the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 made from non-woven materials, if the<br /> use of only non-originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is not possible to start<br /> from non-woven cloth - even if non-woven cloths cannot normally be made from yarn. In<br /> such cases, the starting material would normally be at the stage before yarn - that is the fibre<br /> stage.<br /> 3.6. Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of non-<br /> originating materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be added together. In<br /> other words, the maximum value of all the non-originating materials used may never exceed<br /> the highest of the percentages given. Furthermore, the individual percentages must not be<br /> exceeded in relation to the particular materials they apply to.<br /> Note 4:<br /> 4.1. The term 'natural fibres` is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or<br /> synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and,<br /> unless otherwise specified, includes fibres that have been carded, combed or otherwise<br /> processed but not spun.<br /> 4.2. The term 'natural fibres` includes horsehair of heading No 0503, silk of heading Nos 5002<br /> and 5003 as well as the wool fibres, fine or coarse animal hair of heading Nos 5101 to 5105,<br /> the cotton fibres of heading Nos 5201 to 5203 and the other vegetable fibres of heading Nos<br /> 5301 to 5305.<br /> 4.3. The terms 'textile pulp`, 'chemical materials` and 'paper-making materials` are used in the<br /> list to describe the materials not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to<br /> manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.<br /> 4.4. The term 'man-made staple fibres` is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial<br /> filament   tow,   staple   fibres   or   waste,   of   heading   Nos<br /> Note 5:<br /> 5.1. Where for a given product in the list a reference is made to this note, the conditions set<br /> out in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials, used in the manufacture of<br /> this product, which, taken together, represent 10 per cent or less of the total weight of all the<br /> basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 5.3 and 5.4 below).<br /> 5.2. However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 5.1 may only be applied to mixed products<br /> which have been made from two or more basic textile materials.<br /> The following are the basic textile materials:<br /> - silk,<br /> - wool,<br /> - coarse animal hair,<br /> - fine animal hair,<br /> - horsehair,<br /> - cotton,<br /> - paper-making materials and paper,<br /> - flax,<br /> - true hemp,<br /> - jute and other textile bast fibres,<br /> - sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave,<br /> - coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,<br /> - synthetic man-made filaments,<br /> - artificial man-made filaments,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyphenylene sulphide,<br /> - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyvinyl chloride,<br /> - other synthetic man-made staple fibres,<br /> - artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose,<br /> - other artificial man-made staple fibres,<br /> - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether whether or not<br /> gimped,<br /> - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester whether or not<br /> gimped,<br /> - products of heading No 5605 (metallized yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core of<br /> aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a<br /> width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive<br /> between two layers of plastic film,<br /> - other products of heading No 5605.<br /> Example:<br /> A yarn of heading No 5205 made from cotton fibres of heading No 5203 and synthetic staple<br /> fibres of heading No 5506 is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres<br /> that do not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or<br /> textile pulp) may be used up to a weight of 10 per cent of the yarn.<br /> Example:<br /> A woollen fabric of heading No 5112 made from woollen yarn of heading No 5107 and<br /> synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading No 5509 is a mixed fabric. Therefore synthetic yarn<br /> which does not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or<br /> textile pulp) or woollen yarn that does not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture<br /> from  natural  fibres,  not  carded  or  combed  or  otherwise  prepared  for  spinning)  or  a<br /> combination of the two may be used provided their total weight does not exceed 10 per cent<br /> of the weight of the fabric.<br /> Example:<br /> Tufted textile fabric of heading No 5802 made from cotton yarn of heading No 5205 and<br /> cotton fabric of heading No 5210 is only a mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed<br /> fabric being made from yarns classified in two separate headings or if the cotton yarns used<br /> are themselves mixtures.<br /> Example:<br /> If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading No 5205 and<br /> synthetic fabric of heading No 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic<br /> textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is accordingly a mixed product.<br /> Example:<br /> A carpet with tufts made from both artificial yarns and cotton yarns and with a jute backing is<br /> a mixed product because three basic textile materials are used. Thus, any non-originating<br /> materials that are at a later stage of manufacture than the rule allows may be used, provided<br /> their total weight does not exceed 10 per cent of the weight of the textile materials of the<br /> carpet. Thus, both the jute backing and/or the artificial yarns could be imported at that stage<br /> of manufacture, provided the weight conditions are met.<br /> 5.3. In the case of products incorporating 'yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible<br /> segments of polyether whether or not gimped` this tolerance is 20 per cent in respect of this<br /> yarn.<br /> 5.4. In the case of products incorporating 'strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a<br /> core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5<br /> mm, sandwiched by means of an adhesive between two layers of plastic film`, this tolerance is<br /> 30 per cent in respect of this strip.<br /> Note 6:<br /> 6.1. In the case of those textile products which are marked in the list by a footnote referring to<br /> this note, textile materials, with the exception of linings and interlinings, which do not satisfy<br /> the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the made-up product concerned may be used<br /> provided that they are classified in a heading other than that of the product and that their value<br /> does not exceed 8 per cent of the ex-works price of the product.<br /> 6.2. Without prejudice to Note 6.3, materials which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63<br /> may be used freely in the manufacture of textile products, whether or not they contain textiles.<br /> Example:<br /> If a rule in the list provides that for a particular textile item, such as trousers, yarn must be<br /> used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because buttons are not<br /> classified within Chapters 50 to 63. For the same reason, it does not prevent the use of slide-<br /> fasteners even though slide-fasteners normally contain textiles.<br /> 6.3. Where a percentage rules applies, the value of materials which are not classified within<br /> Chapters 50 to 63 must be taken into account when calculating the value of the non-<br /> originating materials incorporated.<br /> Note 7:<br /> 7.1. For the purposes of heading Nos ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex 3403,<br /> the 'specific processes` are the following:<br /> (a) vacuum distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process (1);<br /> (c) cracking;<br /> (d) reforming;<br /> (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f)  the  process  comprising  all  the  following  operations:  processing  with  concentrated<br /> sulphuric   acid,   oleum   or   sulphuric   anhydride;   neutralization   with   alkaline   agents;<br /> decolorization and purification with naturally active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal<br /> or bauxite;<br /> (g) polymerization;<br /> (h) alkylation;<br /> (i) isomerization.<br /> 7.2. For the purposes of heading Nos 2710, 2711 and 2712, the 'specific processes` are the<br /> following:<br /> (a) vacuum distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process (2);<br /> (c) cracking;<br /> (d) reforming;<br /> (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f)  the  process  comprising  all  the  following  operations:  processing  with  concentrated<br /> sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralization with alkaline agents;<br /> decolorization and purification with naturally active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal<br /> or bauxite;<br /> (g) polymerization;<br /> (h) alkylation;<br /> (ij) isomerization;<br /> (k) in respect of heavy oils falling within heading No ex 2710 only, desulphurization with<br /> hydrogen resulting in a reduction of at least 85 per cent of the sulphur content of the products<br /> processed (ASTM D 1266-59 T method);<br /> (l) in respect of products falling within heading No 2710 only, deparaffining by a process<br /> other than filtering;<br /> (m) in respect of heavy oils falling within heading No ex 2710 only, treatment with hydrogen<br /> at a pressure of more than 20 bar and a temperature of more than 250 \u00b0C with the use of a<br /> catalyst, other than to effect desulphurization, when the hydrogen constitutes an active<br /> element in a chemical reaction. The further treatment with hydrogen of lubricating oils of<br /> heading No ex 2710 (e.g. hydrofinishing or decolorization) in order, more especially, to<br /> improve colour or stability shall not, however, be deemed to be a specific process;<br /> (n) in respect of fuel oils falling within heading No ex 2710 only, atmospheric distillation, on<br /> condition that less than 30 per cent of these products distil, by volume, including losses, at<br /> 300 \u00b0C by the ASTM D 86 method;<br /> (o) in respect of heavy oils other than gas oils and fuel oils falling within heading No ex 2710<br /> only, treatment by means of a high-frequency electrical brush-discharge.<br /> 7.3.

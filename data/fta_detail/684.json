When a chapter, heading or subheading is subject to alternative specific rules of<br /> origin, the rule will be considered to be met if a good satisfies one of the alternatives.<br /> 3. Where a specific rule of origin is defined using the criterion of a change in tariff<br /> classification (hereinafter referred to as \"CTC\" in this Annex), each of the non-<br /> originating materials used in the production of the good shall be required to undergo the<br /> applicable CTC. A requirement of a CTC shall apply only to non-originating materials.<br /> 4. For the purposes of this Annex:<br /> (a) \"chapter\" means the first two digits in the tariff classification number<br /> under the Harmonized System;<br /> (b) \"heading\" means the first four digits in the tariff classification number<br /> under the Harmonized System;<br /> (c) \"section\" means a section of the Harmonized System; and<br /> (d) \"subheading\" means the first six digits in the tariff classification number<br /> under the Harmonized System.<br /> 5. For the purposes of column 3 of the product specific rules set out in this Annex:<br /> (a) \"CC\" denotes a change to the chapter, heading or subheading from any<br /> other chapter. This means that all non-originating materials used in the<br /> production of the good have undergone a CTC at the two-digit level (i.e.<br /> a change in chapter) of the Harmonized System;<br /> (b) \"CTH\" denotes a change to the chapter, heading or subheading from any<br /> other heading. This means that all non-originating materials used in the<br /> production of the good have undergone a CTC at the four-digit level (i.e.<br /> a change in heading) of the Harmonized System;<br /> (c) \"CTSH\" denotes a change to the chapter, heading or subheading from<br /> any other subheading.

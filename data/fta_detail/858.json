or <br /> (ii) the entry is otherwise materially incorrect. <br /> (2) The penalty notice may require the person to pay to the chief executive by way <br /> of penalty and in addition to the duty payable under this Act (if any) the <br /> amount referred to in section 128B(1). <br /> (3) Within 20 working days after the date on which the penalty notice is issued by <br /> the chief executive under subsection (1) (the due date), the person to whom it <br /> was issued- <br /> (a) must pay the penalty: <br /> (b) may request the chief executive to review the decision to issue the no- <br /> tice. <br /> (4) However, section 129(2) applies if the person to whom the penalty notice was <br /> issued requests the chief executive to review the decision to issue the notice <br /> under subsection (3)(b). <br /> (5) The amount of the penalty, including any additional penalty imposed under <br /> section 128C, constitutes a debt due to the Crown and is recoverable by the <br /> chief executive in a court of competent jurisdiction. <br /> (6) A person who pays the amount of the penalty, or for whom that amount is paid, <br /> is not liable to prosecution for an offence in relation to the error or omission <br /> and the goods in relation to which the error or omission occurred are not liable <br /> to seizure under this Act. <br /> (7) Subsection (6) does not apply to a prosecution or seizure in relation to goods <br /> that have been forfeited to the Crown because the importation or exportation of <br /> the goods is prohibited or unlawful. <br /> (8) This section is subject to section 130. <br /> Section 128A: inserted, on 6 April 2012, by section 15 of the Customs and Excise Amendment Act <br /> 128B Calculation of amount of penalty <br /> (1) The amount of the penalty imposed under section 128A(2) is the amount speci- <br /> fied under subsection (2) or (3), as the case may be. <br /> (2) If the error or omission has resulted in an amount of duty payable under this <br /> Act (including any liability for goods and services tax) not being paid or de- <br /> clared for payment, the amount is the greater of- <br /> (a) $200; or <br /> (b) an amount (up to a maximum of $50,000) that is equal to whichever one <br /> of the following applies: <br /> (i) 20% of the duty unpaid or undeclared, if the chief executive is <br /> satisfied that the error or omission occurred because the person <br /> did not take reasonable care; or <br /> (ii) 40% of the duty unpaid or undeclared, if the chief executive is <br /> satisfied that the error or omission occurred because the person <br /> was grossly careless; or <br /> (iii) 100% of the duty unpaid or undeclared, if the chief executive is <br /> satisfied that the error or omission was made knowingly. <br /> (3) If the error or omission has resulted in the entry being materially incorrect, the <br /> amount is the greater of- <br /> (a) $200 for each entry; or <br /> (b) an amount (up to a maximum of $50,000) that is equal to whichever one <br /> of the following applies: <br /> (i) 20% of the excess drawback paid or claimed, if the chief execu- <br /> tive is satisfied that the error or omission occurred because the <br /> person did not take reasonable care; or <br /> (ii) 40% of the excess drawback paid or claimed, if the chief execu- <br /> tive is satisfied that the error or omission occurred because the <br /> person was grossly careless; or <br /> (iii) 100% of the excess drawback paid or claimed, if the chief execu- <br /> tive is satisfied that the error or omission was made knowingly. <br /> (4) If the goods referred to in section 128A(1) and entered under section 39 be- <br /> come free of duty or subject to a lower rate of duty under Part 1 or Part 2 of the <br /> Tariff after the entry is made, the amount of the penalty must be calculated <br /> under subsection (2)(b) as if the duty liability had not changed. <br /> Section 128B: inserted, on 6 April 2012, by section 15 of the Customs and Excise Amendment Act <br /> 128C Additional penalty may be imposed <br /> (1) The additional penalties specified in subsection (2) are imposed (as the case <br /> may be) on a person to whom a penalty notice is issued under section 128A(1) <br /> if the penalty remains unpaid by the due date referred to in section 128A(3), <br /> unless the chief executive decides that the notice should not have been issued <br /> following a request for review under section 128A(3)(b). <br /> (2) The additional penalties are- <br /> (a) 5% of the amount of the penalty unpaid by the due date; and <br /> (b) 2% of the amount of the penalty, including any additional penalty, un- <br /> paid at the end of the period of 1 month after the due date; and <br /> (c) 2% of the amount of the penalty, including any additional penalty, un- <br /> paid at the end of each succeeding period of 1 month. <br /> (3) However, the chief executive may, in his or her discretion, remit or refund the <br /> whole or any part of any additional penalty imposed under subsection (1). <br /> Section 128C: inserted, on 6 April 2012, by section 15 of the Customs and Excise Amendment Act <br /> 129 Obligation to pay penalty not suspended by review or appeal <br /> (1) The obligation to pay and the right to receive and recover any penalty imposed <br /> under section 128A are not suspended by any request for review under section <br /> 128A(3)(b) or by any appeal or legal proceedings. <br /> (2) Subject to the provisions of subsection (3), if the person who requested the re- <br /> view, or the appellant, is successful, the amount of the penalty imposed under <br /> this section shall forthwith be refunded to the person or the appellant by the <br /> chief executive. <br /> (3) The provisions of section 92(3) and section 93 shall, with all necessary modifi- <br /> cations, apply to an administrative penalty required to be refunded under this <br /> section as if such penalty were duty. <br /> Section 129 heading: amended, on 6 April 2012, by section 16(1) of the Customs and Excise Amend- <br /> ment Act 2012 (2012 No 25). <br /> Section 129(1): amended, on 6 April 2012, by section 16(2) of the Customs and Excise Amendment <br /> Section 129(2): amended, on 6 April 2012, by section 16(3)(a) of the Customs and Excise Amend- <br /> ment Act 2012 (2012 No 25). <br /> Section 129(2): amended, on 6 April 2012, by section 16(3)(b) of the Customs and Excise Amend- <br /> ment Act 2012 (2012 No 25). <br /> 130 No penalty in certain cases <br /> A person is not liable to the imposition of a penalty under section 128A, if- <br /> (a) that person has voluntarily disclosed the error or omission to the Cus- <br /> toms before the Customs has notified the person that- <br /> (i) the goods to which the entry relates have been selected for exam- <br /> ination by the Customs: <br /> (ii) documentation is required to be presented to the Customs in rela- <br /> tion to that entry: <br /> (iii) the Customs intends to conduct an audit or investigation in rela- <br /> tion to a selection of entries that includes that entry, or in relation <br /> to entries made over a period of time that includes the time the <br /> entry was made;

of information <br> (1) The Customs may without warrant view all information to which access is <br> given under section 38D. <br> (2) However, the Customs may view information to which access is given under <br> section 38E only as provided in sections 38H to 38K. <br> (3) Section 282A applies to the collection, use, and disclosure by the Customs of <br> information viewed by the Customs under this section or any of sections 38H <br> to 38K. <br> Section 38G: inserted, on 1 October 2004, by section 15 of the Customs and Excise Amendment Act <br> Searching and viewing by Customs of information about border-crossing <br> persons <br> 38H Information about travel within 28-day period <br> (1) Information to which access is given under section 38E may be viewed by the <br> Customs without warrant if it is information about travel within the 28-day <br> period. <br> (2) The Customs may without warrant search information that it may view under <br> subsection (1) to determine whether that information includes information that <br> is relevant to search criteria specified by the Customs. <br> (3) However, if information is viewed under subsection (1), the Customs may col- <br> lect, use, and disclose that information in accordance with section 282A wheth- <br> er or not it came to the attention of the Customs as a result of a search. <br> (4) Powers under this section of viewing or searching are exercisable in a particu- <br> (5) For the purposes of this section and section 38I, information about travel <br> within the 28-day period means information that, at any particular time, re- <br> lates\u2014 <br> (a) to an arrival in, or departure from, New Zealand that, according to the <br> information,\u2014 <br> (i) occurred within 14 days before that time; or <br> (ii) is occurring at that time; or <br> (iii) will occur within 14 days after that time; or <br> (b) to travel that, according to the information, occurred, is occurring, or <br> will occur, in connection with an arrival or departure referred to in para- <br> graph (a),\u2014 <br> (i) whether that travel is travel within New Zealand or overseas; and <br> (ii) whether that travel is travel that occurred, is occurring, or will <br> occur, before or after the arrival or departure of that kind. <br> Section 38H: inserted, on 1 October 2004, by section 15 of the Customs and Excise Amendment Act <br> 38I Information about other travel may be searched for information relating <br> to travellers within 28-day period <br> (1) In this section, information about other travel means information\u2014 <br> (a) to which access is given under section 38E; and <br> (b) that is not information about travel within the 28-day period. <br> (2) This section applies to the following situation: <br> (a) the Customs, in considering information viewed under section 38H, <br> finds information about travel within the 28-day period that relates to an <br> arrival or departure, and to travel, by a person: <br> (b) the Customs wishes\u2014 <br> (i) to search information about other travel to determine whether it <br> includes information that relates to that person; and <br> (ii) to view any information that relates to that person and is found as <br> a result of the search. <br> (3) In that situation, the Customs may without warrant\u2014 <br> (a) search information about other travel to determine whether it includes <br> information that relates to the person; and <br> (b) view information in accordance with subsection (5). <br> (4) However, the search may be conducted only if it can be completed within 14 <br> days after the arrival or departure to which the information about travel within <br> the 28-day period relates (see section 38H(5)(a)). <br> (5) The Customs must not view information about other travel unless that informa- <br> tion relates to the person and is found as a result of the search. <br> (6) Powers under this section of viewing or searching are exercisable in a particu- <br> lar case even though, in the circumstances of that case, the purpose of the view- <br> ing or searching would not be, or would not be likely to be, frustrated if the <br> viewing or searching were delayed until a warrant under section 38J could be <br> obtained to authorise it. <br> Section 38I: inserted, on 1 October 2004, by section 15 of the Customs and Excise Amendment Act <br> 38J Search and viewing warrants <br> (a) the chief executive considers, in the light of information of any kind that <br> is available to the Customs, that there are reasonable grounds to suspect <br> that\u2014 <br> (i) there exists a risk or threat relevant to the purpose stated in section <br> 38B(1); or <br> (ii) a relevant offence (as defined in subsection (6)) has been, is being, <br> or will be committed: <br> (i) to search information to which access is given under section 38E <br> to determine whether it includes information that is relevant to <br> search criteria specified by the Customs (being search criteria that <br> are reasonably related to the information available to the Customs <br> that gives rise to the reasonable grounds to suspect required by <br> paragraph (a)); and <br> (ii) to view any information that is relevant to the search criteria spe- <br> cified by the Customs and is found as a result of the search: <br> (c) the search cannot be conducted and the viewing done under section 38H <br> or section 38I, or the Customs considers it would be inexpedient for <br> those things to be done under section 38H or section 38I. <br> (2) In that situation, the chief executive may, by application in writing made on <br> oath, apply to a District Court Judge for a search and viewing warrant author- <br> ising\u2014 <br> (a) the carrying out of the search within 14 days after the day on which the <br> warrant is granted (or within any extension of that period granted by a <br> District Court Judge on an application in writing for the purpose made <br> within that period); and <br> (b) the viewing by the Customs of any information that is relevant to the <br> search criteria specified by the Customs and that is included in informa- <br> tion to which access is given under section 38E, but of no other informa- <br> (3) The application must give details of the reasonable grounds to suspect required <br> by subsection (1), of the information available to the Customs that gives rise to <br> those reasonable grounds to suspect, and of the search criteria specified by the <br> Customs, and it must also indicate whether the search is to be of all, or of only <br> a specified part or parts, of the information to which access is given under sec- <br> tion 38E. <br> (4) On an application under subsection (2), a District Court Judge may grant a <br> search and viewing warrant in the prescribed form, but only if he or she is <br> satisfied that\u2014 <br> (a) the reasonable grounds to suspect required by subsection (1) exist; and <br> (b) the search criteria specified by the Customs are reasonably related to the <br> information available to the Customs that gives rise to those reasonable <br> grounds to suspect. <br> (5) The warrant is sufficient authority for the doing of the things specified in sub- <br> section (2)(a) and (b). <br> (6) In this section and section 38K, relevant offence means an offence described <br> in section 38B(1)(b), or relevant to the purpose stated in section 38B(1) (except <br> paragraph (b)). <br> Section 38J: inserted, on 1 October 2004, by section 15 of the Customs and Excise Amendment Act <br> 38K Search and viewing without warrant in emergencies <br> (1) This section applies to the following situation: <br> (a) the situation specified in section 38J(1) applies: <br> (b) the chief executive considers that, if he or she were to apply to a District <br> Court Judge for a search and viewing warrant under section 38J, the Dis- <br> trict Court Judge would grant the warrant: <br> (c) the chief executive also considers that delaying a search and any result- <br> ing viewing until a search and viewing warrant can be obtained under <br> section 38J would create a real risk that\u2014 <br> (i) the countering of the risk or threat referred to in section <br> 38J(1)(a)(i) would be frustrated; or (as the case requires) <br> (ii) the prevention, detection, investigation, prosecution, or punish- <br> ment of the relevant offence would be frustrated. <br> (2) In that situation, the chief executive may, with no further authority than this <br> section, have the things specified in section 38J(2)(a) and (b) done as if the do- <br> ing of those things were authorised by a search and viewing warrant under sec- <br> tion 38J(4). <br> (3) However, if the chief executive acts under subsection (2), he or she must within <br> 72 hours apply under section 38J(2) for a search and viewing warrant in rela- <br> tion to the matter. <br> Section 38K: inserted, on 1 October 2004, by section 15 of the Customs and Excise Amendment Act <br> 38L Procedure if viewing of information not authorised <br> (1) This subsection applies to both of the following situations: <br> (a) the 72-hour period referred to in section 38K(3) expires and the chief <br> executive has not made the application required by that subsection: <br> (b) the application required by section 38K(3) is made but, in response to it, <br> either no warrant is granted under section 38J(4), or a warrant is granted <br> under section 38J(4) authorising the doing of some only of the things <br> done in reliance on section 38K(2). <br> (2) In a situation to which subsection (1) applies, things done in reliance on section <br> 38K(2) must, to the extent that the doing of those things is not authorised by a <br> warrant granted under section 38J(4), be treated for the purposes only of the <br> countering of the risk or threat referred to in section 38J(1)(a)(i) or (as the case <br> requires) of the prevention, detection, investigation, prosecution, or punishment <br> of the relevant offence, as if they were done without the authority of section <br> 38K or of a warrant granted under section 38J(4). <br> (3) In a situation to which subsection (1) applies,\u2014 <br> (a) the Customs must destroy immediately information viewed by it in reli- <br> ance on section 38K(2) and that is collected by it for a purpose specified <br> in section 282A if the viewing of that information is not authorised by a <br> warrant granted under section 38J(4); and <br> (b) other persons or bodies must destroy immediately information viewed <br> by the Customs in reliance on section 38K(2) and disclosed by it to the <br> other persons or bodies for a purpose specified in section 282A(2) and <br> collected by the other persons or bodies if the viewing of that informa- <br> tion is not authorised by a warrant granted under section 38J(4). <br> Section 38L: inserted, on 1 October 2004, by section 15 of the Customs and Excise Amendment Act <br> 38M Security of applications for warrants <br> (1) As soon as an application under section 38J(2) has been determined by the <br> Judge, the Registrar must place all documents relating to the application (ex- <br> cept the warrant itself) in a packet, seal the packet, and thereafter keep it in safe <br> custody, except as provided in this section. <br> (2) Despite any enactment or rule of law or rules of court entitling a party to pro- <br> ceedings to demand the production of documents, no party of that kind is en- <br> titled to demand the production of documents held in safe custody under sub- <br> section (1), except in accordance with this section. <br> (3) Every party of that kind who requires the production of a document held in safe <br> custody under subsection (1) must, except in a case to which subsection (9) or <br> subsection (10) applies, apply in writing to the Registrar, who must promptly <br> notify the chief executive. <br> (4) If, within 3 days after notice is given to the chief executive under subsection <br> (3), the chief executive gives written notice to the Registrar that he or she in- <br> tends to oppose the production of the documents, the Registrar must refer the <br> matter to a District Court Judge. <br> (5) If the chief executive does not give the written notice referred to in subsection <br> (4), the Registrar must produce the documents to the party applying for produc- <br> tion. <br> (6) If a matter is referred to a Judge under subsection (4), both the person request- <br> ing production of the documents and the chief executive opposing production <br> must be given an opportunity to be heard. <br> (7) The Judge may order that all or a specified part of a document the production <br> of which is in dispute not be produced if he or she is satisfied that\u2014 <br> (a) the document or part contains information of a kind referred to in section <br> 38N(1); and <br> (b) production of that information would involve disclosure of a kind re- <br> ferred to in section 38N(2). <br> (8) Subject to subsection (7), the Judge must order the production of the docu- <br> ments to the party requesting it. <br> (9) If a request for the production of a document kept in safe custody under sub- <br> section (1) is made in the course of proceedings presided over by a District <br> Court Judge and the request is opposed, the Judge must adjudicate upon the <br> matter as if it had been referred to him or her under subsection (4). <br> (10) If a request of that kind is made in the course of any other proceedings, the pre- <br> siding judicial officer must promptly refer the matter to a District Court Judge <br> for adjudication of the kind referred to in subsection (9). <br> (11) Despite anything in this section, every District Court Judge or Judge of the <br> High Court who is presiding over any proceedings in which the issue of a war- <br> rant under section 38J is in issue is entitled to inspect any relevant document <br> held under subsection (1). <br> Compare: 1978 No 65 s 20 <br> Section 38M: inserted, on 1 October

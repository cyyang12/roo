Unless otherwise specified, a requirement of a change in tariff classification or any other condition set out in a product-specific rule of origin applies only to non-originating material.<br /> 5. Section, chapter, heading or subheading notes, where applicable, are found at the beginning of each new section, chapter, heading or subheading.

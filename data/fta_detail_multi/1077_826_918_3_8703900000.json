This Annex sets out the general rules for the applicable requirements of Annex ORIG-2<br /> [Product-specific rules of origin] as provided for in point (c) of Article ORIG 3(1) [General requirements]<br /> of this Agreement.<br /> 2. For the purposes of this Annex and Annex ORIG-2 [Product-specific rules of origin], the<br /> requirements for a product to be originating in accordance with point (c) of Article ORIG.3(1) [General<br /> Requirements] of this Agreement are a change in tariff classification, a production process, a<br /> maximum value or weight of non-originating materials, or any other requirement specified in this<br /> Annex and Annex ORIG-2 [Product-specific rules of origin].<br /> 3. Reference to weight in a product-specific rule of origin means the net weight, which is the<br /> weight of a material or a product, not including the weight of any packaging.<br /> 4. This Annex and Annex ORIG-2 [Product-specific rules of origin] are based on the Harmonised<br /> System, as amended on 1 January 2017.<br /> Note 2<br /> The Structure of the List of Product-specific Rules of Origin<br /> 1. Notes on sections or chapters, where applicable, are read in conjunction with the product-<br /> specific rules of origin for the relevant section, chapter, heading or subheading.<br /> 2. Each product-specific rule of origin set out in Column 2 of Annex ORIG-2 [Product-specific rules<br /> of origin] applies to the corresponding product indicated in Column 1 of Annex ORIG-2 [Product-<br /> specific rules of origin].<br /> 3. If a product is subject to alternative product-specific rules of origin, the product shall be<br /> originating in a Party if it satisfies one of the alternatives.<br /> 4. If a product is subject to a product-specific rule of origin that includes multiple requirements,<br /> the product shall be originating in a Party only if it satisfies all of the requirements.<br /> 5. For the purposes of this Annex and Annex ORIG-2 [Product-specific rules of origin], the<br /> following definitions apply:<br /> (a) \u2018section' means a section of the Harmonised System;<br /> (b) \u2018Chapter' means the first two-digits in the tariff classification number under the Harmonised<br /> System;<br /> (c) \u2018heading' means the first four-digits in the tariff classification number under the Harmonised<br /> System; and<br /> (d) \u2018subheading' means the first six-digits in the tariff classification number under the Harmonised<br /> System.<br /> 2. For the purposes of the product-specific rules of origin, the following abbreviations apply:<br /> \u2018CC' means production from non-originating materials of any Chapter, except that of the product; this<br /> means that any non-originating material used in the production of the product must be classified in a<br /> Chapter (2-digit level of the Harmonised System) other than that of the product (i.e. a change in<br /> Chapter);<br /> \u2018CTH' means production from non-originating materials of any heading, except that of the product;<br /> this means that any non-originating material used in the production of the product must be classified<br /> in a heading (4-digit level of the Harmonised System) other than that of the product (i.e. a change in<br /> heading);<br /> \u2018CTSH' means production from non-originating materials of any subheading, except that of the<br /> product; this means that any non-originating material used in the production of the product must be<br /> classified in a subheading (6-digit level of the Harmonised System) other than that of the product (i.e.<br /> a change in sub-heading).<br /> Note 3<br /> Application of the Product-specific Rules of Origin<br /> 1. Article ORIG.3(2) [General requirements] of this Agreement, concerning products having<br /> acquired originating status which are used in the production of other products, applies whether or not<br /> this status has been acquired inside the same factory in a Party where these products are used.<br /> 2. If a product-specific rule of origin specifically excludes certain non-originating material or<br /> provides that the value or weight of a specified non-originating material shall not exceed a specific<br /> threshold, these conditions do not apply to non-originating materials classified elsewhere in the<br /> Harmonised System.<br /> 3. Example 1: when the rule for bulldozers (HS sub-heading 8429.11) requires: \"CTH except from<br /> non-originating materials of heading 84.31 parts suitable solely for machinery of heading 84.25 to<br /> 84.30\", the use of non-originating materials classified elsewhere than 84.29 and 84.31- such as screws<br /> (HS heading 73.18), insulated wires and electric conductors (HS heading 85.44) and various<br /> electronics (HS Chapter 85) - is not limited.<br /> Example 2: When the rule for heading 35.05 (dextrins and other modified starches; glues based on<br /> starches etc) requires \u2018CTH except from non-originating heading 11.08' then the use of non-originating<br /> materials classified elsewhere than 11.08 (starches, inulin), such as materials of Chapter 10 (cereals),<br /> is not limited.<br /> 4. If a product-specific rule of origin provides that a product shall be produced from a particular<br /> material, this does not prevent the use of other materials which are unable to satisfy that rule because<br /> of their inherent nature.<br /> Note 4<br /> Calculation of a maximum value of non-originating materials<br /> For the purposes of the product-specific rules of origin, the following definitions apply:<br /> (a) \"customs value\" means the value as determined in accordance with the Agreement on<br /> Implementation of Article VII of GATT 1994;<br /> (b) \"EXW\" or \"ex-works price\" means:<br /> (i) the price of the product paid or payable to the producer in whose undertaking the last<br /> working or processing is carried out, provided that the price includes the value of all the<br /> materials used and all other costs incurred in the production of the product, minus any<br /> internal taxes which are, or may be, repaid when the product obtained is exported; or<br /> (ii) if there is no price paid or payable or if the actual price paid does not reflect all costs<br /> related to the production of the product which are actually incurred in the production<br /> of the product, the value of all the materials used and all other costs incurred in the<br /> production of the product in the exporting Party:<br /> (A) including selling, general and administrative expenses, as well as profit, that<br /> can reasonably be allocated to the product; and<br /> (B) excluding the cost of freight, insurance, all other costs incurred in<br /> transporting the product and any internal taxes of the exporting Party which<br /> are, or may be, repaid when the product obtained is exported.<br /> (iii) For the purposes of point (i), where the last production has been contracted to a<br /> producer, the term \u2018producer' in point (i) refers to the person who has employed the<br /> subcontractor.<br /> (c) \"MaxNOM\" means the maximum value of non-originating materials expressed as a percentage<br /> and shall be calculated according to the following formula:<br /> VNM<br /> MaxNOM (%) = ---- x 100<br /> EXW<br /> (d) \"VNM\" means the value of the non-originating materials used in the production of the product,<br /> which is its customs value at the time of importation, including freight, insurance if appropriate,<br /> packing and all other costs incurred in transporting the materials to the importation port in the<br /> Party where the producer of the product is located; where the value of the non-originating<br /> materials is not known and cannot be ascertained, the first ascertainable price paid for the non-<br /> originating materials in the Union or in the United Kingdom is used; the value of the non-<br /> originating materials used in the production of the product may be calculated on the basis of<br /> the weighted average value formula or other inventory valuation method under accounting<br /> principles which are generally accepted in the Party.<br /> Note 5<br /> Definitions of processes referred to in Sections V to VII in Annex ORIG-2 [Product-specific rules of<br /> origin]<br /> For the purposes of product-specific rules of origin, the following definitions apply:<br /> (a) \u2018biotechnological processing' means:<br /> (i) biological or biotechnological culturing (including cell culture), hybridisation or genetic<br /> modification of micro- organisms (bacteria, viruses (including phages) etc.) or human,<br /> animal or plant cells;

or<br /> (vii) nuclear grade uses.<br /> Note 6<br /> Definitions of terms used in Section XI of Annex ORIG-2 [Product-<br /> specific rules of origin]<br /> For the purposes of the product-specific rules of origin, the following definitions apply:<br /> (a) \u2018man-made staple fibres' means synthetic or artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of<br /> headings 55.01 to 55.07;<br /> (b) \u2018natural fibres' means fibres other than synthetic or artificial fibres, the use of which is restricted<br /> to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless otherwise specified,<br /> includes fibres which have been carded, combed or otherwise processed, but not spun; \u2018natural<br /> fibres' includes horsehair of heading 05.11, silk of headings 50.02 and 50.03, wool-fibres and<br /> fine or coarse animal hair of headings 51.01 to 51.05, cotton fibres of headings 52.01 to 52.03,<br /> and other vegetable fibres of headings 53.01 to 53.05;<br /> (c) \u2018printing' means a technique by which an objectively assessed function, such as colour, design,<br /> or technical performance, is given to a textile substrate with a permanent character, using<br /> screen, roller, digital or transfer techniques; and<br /> (d) \u2018printing (as standalone operation)' means a technique by which an objectively assessed<br /> function, such as colour, design, or technical performance, is given to a textile substrate with a<br /> permanent character, using screen, roller, digital or transfer techniques combined with at least<br /> two preparatory or finishing operations (such as scouring, bleaching, mercerizing, heat setting,<br /> raising, calendaring, shrink resistance processing, permanent finishing, decatising,<br /> impregnating, mending and burling, shearing, singeing, process of air-tumbler, process of<br /> stenter, milling, steam and shrinking, and wet decatising), provided that the value of all the non-<br /> originating materials used does not exceed 50 % of the EXW of the product.<br /> Note 7<br /> Tolerances applicable to products containing two or more basic<br /> textile materials<br /> 1. For the purposes of this Note, basic textile materials are the following:<br /> (a) silk;<br /> (b) wool;<br /> (c) coarse animal hair;<br /> (d) fine animal hair;<br /> (e) horsehair;<br /> (f) cotton;<br /> (g) paper-making materials and paper;<br /> (h) flax;<br /> (i) true hemp;<br /> (j) jute and other textile bast fibres;<br /> (k) sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave;<br /> (l) coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres;<br /> (m) synthetic man-made filaments;<br /> (n) artificial man-made filaments;<br /> (o) current-conducting filaments; uth<br /> (p) synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene;<br /> (q) synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester;<br /> (r) synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide;<br /> (s) synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile;<br /> (t) synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide;<br /> (u) synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene;<br /> (v) synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly (phenylene sulphide);<br /> (w) synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly (vinyl chloride);<br /> (x) other synthetic man-made staple fibres;<br /> (y) artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose;<br /> (z) other artificial man-made staple fibres;<br /> (aa) yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not<br /> gimped;<br /> (bb) yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester whether or not<br /> gimped;<br /> (cc) products of heading 56.05 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core of aluminium<br /> foil or of a core of plastic film irrespective of whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of<br /> a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive<br /> between two layers of plastic film;<br /> (dd) other products of heading 56.05;<br /> (ee) glass fibres; and<br /> (ff) metal fibres.<br /> 2. Where reference to this Note is made in Annex ORIG-2 [Product-specific rules of origin], the<br /> requirements set out in its Column 2 shall not apply, as a tolerance, to non-originating basic textile<br /> materials which are used in the production of a product, provided that:<br /> (a) the product contains two or more basic textile materials; and<br /> (b) the weight of the non-originating basic textile materials, taken together, does not exceed 10 %<br /> of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used.<br /> Example: For a woollen fabric of heading 51.12 containing woollen yarn of heading 51.07,<br /> synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading 55.09 and materials other than basic textile<br /> materials, non-originating woollen yarn which does not satisfy the requirement set out<br /> in Annex ORIG-2 [Product-specific rules of origin], or non-originating synthetic yarn<br /> which does not satisfy the requirement set out in Annex ORIG-2 [Product-specific rules<br /> of origin], or a combination of both, may be used, provided that their total weight does<br /> not exceed 10 % of the weight of all the basic textile materials.<br /> 3. Notwithstanding Note 7.2 (b), for products containing \u2018yarn made of polyurethane segmented<br /> with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped', the maximum tolerance is 20 %.<br /> However, the percentage of the other non-originating basic textile materials shall not exceed 10 %.<br /> 4.

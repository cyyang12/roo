<br /> (b) for a material acquired in the territory where the good is produced: <br /> (i) the price paid or payable by the producer in the Party where the producer is <br /> located; <br /> (ii) the value as determined for an imported material in subparagraph (a); <br /> (iii) the earliest ascertainable price paid or payable in the territory of the Party; <br /> or <br /> (c) for a material that is self-produced: <br /> (i) all the costs incurred in the production of the material, which includes <br /> general expenses;

<br /> (b) duties, taxes, and customs brokerage fees on the material paid in the territory of one <br /> or more of the Parties, other than duties and taxes that are waived, refunded, <br /> refundable, or otherwise recoverable, which include credit against duty or tax paid <br /> or payable; and <br /> (c) the cost of waste and spoilage resulting from the use of the material in the <br /> production of the good, less the value of reusable scrap or by-product. <br /> 2 If the cost or expense listed in paragraph 1 is unknown or documentary evidence of the <br /> amount of the adjustment is not available, then no adjustment is allowed for that particular cost.", "ProvisionValueCssClass": "", "ProvisionDisplayCssClass": null}, {"ProvisionAbbrev": "indir", "ProvisionCode": "Indirect materials", "ProvisionValue": "included", "ProvisionRank": null, "ProvisionGlossary": "A provision which specifies that the origin of certain materials (referred to as indirect or neutral) used in the production process should not be taken into account when determining the origin of the final good.", "ProvisionGlossaryLink": "/en/glossary?uid=indir&returnto=gloscenter", "ProvisionLegalExtract": "Article 4.9: Indirect Materials <br /> An indirect material shall be considered to be an originating material without regard to <br /> where it is produced.", "ProvisionValueCssClass": "green", "ProvisionDisplayCssClass": null}, {"ProvisionAbbrev": "trans", "ProvisionCode": "Direct transport", "ProvisionValue": "included", "ProvisionRank": null, "ProvisionGlossary": "A provision requiring goods that are claiming preferential treatment under an FTA to be shipped directly from the FTA country of origin to the FTA country of destination.", "ProvisionGlossaryLink": "/en/glossary?uid=trans&returnto=gloscenter", "ProvisionLegalExtract": "Article 4.18: Transit and Transshipment <br /> 1 Each Party shall provide that an originating good retains its originating status if the good <br /> has been transported to the importing Party without passing through the territory of a non-Party. <br /> 2 Each Party shall provide that if an originating good is transported outside the territories of <br /> the Parties, the good retains its originating status if the good: <br /> (a) remains under customs control in the territory of a non-Party;

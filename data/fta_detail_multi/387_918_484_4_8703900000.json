The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column contains the Harmonised<br /> System heading number or chapter number and the second column contains the description of goods used in<br /> that system for that heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in columns 3<br /> or 4. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by \u2018ex', this signifies that the rules in<br /> columns 3 or 4 apply only to the part of that heading as described in column 2.<br /> 2.2. Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number is given and the<br /> description of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rules in columns 3 or 4<br /> apply to all products which in the Harmonised System are classified under such headings of the chapter, or in<br /> any of the headings grouped together in column 1.<br /> 2.3. Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each indent contains<br /> the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rules in columns 3 or 4.<br /> 2.4. Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns 3 and 4, the exporter may opt,<br /> as an alternative, to apply either the rule set out in column 3 or that set out in column 4. If no origin rule is<br /> given in column 4, the rule set out in column 3 has to be applied.<br /> Note 3<br /> 3.1. The provisions of Article 5 of Annex III concerning products having acquired originating status which are used<br /> in the manufacture of other products apply, regardless of whether this product has been manufactured in the<br /> same factory or in another factory in Mexico or in the Community.<br /> Example:<br /> An engine of heading No 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-originating materials which<br /> may be incorporated may not exceed 40 % (1) of the ex-works price, is made from \u2018other alloy steel roughly<br /> shaped by forging' of heading No ex 7224.<br /> If  this  forging  has  been  forged  in  the  Community  from  a  non-originating  ingot,  it  has  already  acquired<br /> originating status by virtue of the rule for heading No ex 7224 in the list. The forging can then count as<br /> originating in the value calculation for the engine regardless of whether it was produced in Mexico or the<br /> Community. The value of the non-originating ingot is thus not taken into account when adding up the value of<br /> the non-originating materials used.<br /> 3.2. The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing required and the carrying out of<br /> more working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the carrying out of less working or<br /> processing cannot confer originating status. Thus if a rule provides that non-originating material at a certain level<br /> of manufacture may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed and the use of<br /> such material at a later stage is not.<br /> 3.3. Without prejudice to note 3.2 where a rule states that \u2018materials of any heading' may be used, materials of the<br /> same heading as the product may also be used, subject, however, to any specific limitations which may also be<br /> contained in the rule. However, the expression \u2018manufacture from materials of any heading, including other<br /> materials of heading No \u2026' means that only materials classified in the same heading as the product of a different<br /> description than that of the product as given in column 2 of the list may be used.<br /> (1) See note 11 Appendix II(a).<br /> 968<br /> 3.4. The  unit  of  qualification  for  the  determination  of  origin  is  the  particular  product  as  classified  under  the<br /> nomenclature of the Harmonised System. It follows that packaging classified with the goods, for example the<br /> boxes in which a product is packed for presentation for retail sale, must be included as part of the product when<br /> determining the origin of the product. Packaging designed only for the transportation of the goods to the Party<br /> of importation shall be disregarded.<br /> Example:<br /> Computers of heading No 8471 have a rule where the value of the non-originating materials used does not<br /> exceed 40 % of the ex-works price. They are packed in boxes for retail sale and are exported in wooden<br /> containers with 10 computers in each container. In order to determine whether the computers comply with the<br /> percentage given for the product, the value of the wooden containers should be disregarded. However, the value<br /> of the retail packaging shall be included.<br /> 3.5. When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one material, this means<br /> that any one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all be used.<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for fabrics of heading Nos 5208 to 5212 provides that natural fibres may be used and that chemical<br /> materials, among other materials, may also be used. This does not mean that both have to be used; it is possible<br /> to use one or the other or both.<br /> 3.6. Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular material, the condition<br /> obviously does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the<br /> rule (See also note 6.2 in relation to textiles).<br /> However, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be manufactured from the particular<br /> materials specified in the list, can be produced from a material of the same nature at an earlier stage of<br /> manufacture.<br /> Example:<br /> The rule for prepared foods of heading No 1904 which specifically excludes the use of cereals and their<br /> derivatives does not prevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and other additives which are not products from<br /> cereals.<br /> Example:<br /> In the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 (1) made from non-woven materials, if the use of only<br /> non-originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is not possible to start from non-woven cloth even if<br /> non-woven cloth cannot normally be made from yarn. In such cases, the starting material would normally be at<br /> the stage before yarn, that is the fibre stage.<br /> 3.7. Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of non-originating materials that<br /> can be used, then these percentages may not be added together. In other words, the maximum value of all the<br /> non-originating  materials  used  may  never  exceed  the  highest  of  the  percentages  given.  Furthermore,  the<br /> individual percentages must not be exceeded in relation to the particular materials they apply to.<br /> Note 4<br /> 4.1.  The term \u2018natural fibres' is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic fibres. It is restricted<br /> to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres that<br /> have been carded, combed or otherwise processed, but not spun.<br /> 4.2.  The term \u2018natural fibres' includes horsehair of heading No 0503, silk of heading Nos 5002 and 5003 as well as<br /> wool fibres, fine or coarse animal hair of heading Nos 5101 to 5105, cotton fibres of heading Nos 5201 to<br /> 5203 and other vegetable fibres of heading Nos 5301 to 5305.<br /> (1) See note 6 Appendix II(a).<br /> 29.9.2000<br /> 4.3.  The terms \u2018textile pulp', \u2018chemical materials' and \u2018paper-making materials' are used in the list to describe the<br /> materials not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper<br /> fibres or yarns.<br /> 4.4.  The term \u2018man-made staple fibres' is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament tow, staple fibres or<br /> waste, of heading Nos 5501 to 5507.<br /> Note 5<br /> 5.1. Where for a given product in the list a reference is made to this note, the conditions set out in column 3 shall<br /> not apply to any basic textile materials used in the manufacture of this product, which, taken together, represent<br /> 8 % or less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also notes 5.3 and 5.4).<br /> 5.2. However, the tolerance mentioned in note 5.1 may only apply to mixed products which have been made from<br /> two or more basic textile materials.<br /> The following are the basic textile materials:<br /> \u2014 silk,<br /> \u2014 wool,<br /> \u2014 coarse animal hair,<br /> \u2014 fine animal hair,<br /> \u2014 horsehair,<br /> \u2014 cotton,<br /> \u2014 paper-making materials and paper,<br /> \u2014 flax,<br /> \u2014 true hemp,<br /> \u2014 jute and other textile bast fibres,<br /> \u2014 sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave,<br /> \u2014 coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made filaments,<br /> \u2014 artificial man-made filaments,<br /> \u2014 current conducting filaments,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene,<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyphenylene sulphide,<br /> 970<br /> \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyvinyl chloride,<br /> \u2014 other synthetic man-made staple fibres,<br /> \u2014 artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose,<br /> \u2014 other artificial man-made staple fibres,<br /> \u2014 yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether whether or not gimped,<br /> \u2014 yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester whether or not gimped,<br /> \u2014 products of heading No 5605 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or<br /> of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm,<br /> sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film,<br /> \u2014 other products of heading No 5605.<br /> Example:<br /> A yarn of heading No 5205 made from cotton fibres of heading No 5203 and synthetic staple fibres of heading<br /> No 5506 is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres that do not satisfy the origin rules<br /> (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) may be used up to a weight of 8 % of the<br /> yarn.<br /> Example:<br /> A woollen fabric of heading No 5112 made from woollen yarn of heading No 5107 and synthetic yarn of staple<br /> fibres of heading No 5509 is a mixed fabric. Therefore synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules<br /> (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) or woollen yarn that does not satisfy the<br /> origin rules (which require manufacture from natural fibres, not carded or combed or otherwise prepared for<br /> spinning) or a combination of the two may be used provided their total weight does not exceed 8 % of the<br /> weight of the fabric.<br /> Example:<br /> Tufted textile fabric of heading No 5802 made from cotton yarn of heading No 5205 and cotton fabric of<br /> heading No 5210 is only a mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric being made from yarns<br /> classified in two separate headings or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.<br /> Example:<br /> If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading No 5205 and synthetic fabric<br /> of heading No 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile<br /> fabric is accordingly a mixed product.<br /> 5.3. In the case of products incorporating \u2018yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether<br /> whether or not gimped' this tolerance is 8 % in respect of this yarn.<br /> 5.4. In the case of products incorporating \u2018strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film<br /> whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of an<br /> adhesive between two layers of plastic film', this tolerance is 30 % in respect of this strip.<br /> Note 6<br /> 6.1.  In the case of those textile products which are marked in the list by a footnote referring to this note, textile<br /> materials, with the exception of linings and interlinings, which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in<br /> column 3 for the made-up product concerned may be used provided that they are classified in a heading other<br /> than that of the product and that their value does not exceed 8 % of the ex-works price of the product.<br /> 29.9.2000<br /> 6.2. Without prejudice to note 6.3, materials which are not classified in Chapters 50 to 63 may be used freely in the<br /> manufacture of textile products, whether or not they contain textiles.<br /> Example:<br /> If a rule in the list provides that for a particular textile item, such as trousers, yarn must be used, this does not<br /> prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because buttons are not classified in Chapters 50 to 63. For the<br /> same reason, it does not prevent the use of slide-fasteners even though slide-fasteners normally contain textiles.<br /> 6.3. Where a percentage rule applies, the value of materials which are not classified in Chapters 50 to 63 must be<br /> taken into account when calculating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.<br /> Note 7<br /> 7.1. For the purposes of heading Nos ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex 3403, the \u2018specific processes'<br /> are the following:<br /> (a) vacuum distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process (1);<br /> (c) cracking;<br /> (d) reforming;<br /> (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f) the process comprising all the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or<br /> sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolorisation and purification with naturally active<br /> earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;<br /> (g) polymerisation;<br /> (h) alkylation;<br /> (i) isomerisation.<br /> 7.2. For the purposes of heading Nos 2710, 2711 and 2712, the \u2018specific processes' are the following:<br /> (a) vacuum distillation;<br /> (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process (1);<br /> (c) cracking;<br /> (d) reforming;<br /> (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;<br /> (f) the process comprising all the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or<br /> sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolorisation and purification with naturally active<br /> earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;<br /> (g) polymerisation;<br /> (h) alkylation;<br /> (i) isomerisation;<br /> (k) in respect of heavy oils falling of heading No ex 2710 only, desulphurisation with hydrogen resulting in a<br /> reduction of at least 85 % of the sulphur content of the products processed (ASTM D 1266-59 T method);<br /> (1) See introductory note 7.4.<br /> 972<br /> (l) in respect of products of heading No 2710 only, deparaffining by a process other than filtering;<br /> (m) in respect of heavy oils of heading No ex 2710 only, treatment with hydrogen at a pressure of more than 20<br /> bar and a temperature of more than 250 \u00b0C with the use of a catalyst, other than to effect desulphurisation,<br /> when  the  hydrogen  constitutes  an  active  element  in  a  chemical  reaction.  The  further  treatment  with<br /> hydrogen of lubricating oils of heading No ex 2710 (e.g. hydrofinishing or decolorisation) in order, more<br /> especially, to improve colour or stability shall not, however, be deemed to be a specific process;<br /> (n)  in respect of fuel oils of heading No ex 2710 only, atmospheric distillation, on condition that less than 30 %<br /> of these products distil, by volume, including losses, at 300 \u00b0C by the ASTM D 86 method;<br /> (o)  in respect of heavy oils other than gas oils and fuel oils of heading No ex 2710 only, treatment by means of<br /> a high-frequency electrical brush-discharge.<br /> 7.3. For the purposes of heading Nos ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex 3403, simple operations such<br /> as cleaning, decanting, desalting, water separation, filtering, colouring, marking, obtaining a sulphur content as a<br /> result of mixing products with different sulphur content, any combination of these operations or like operations<br /> do not confer origin.<br /> 7.4. Redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process means distillation (other than topping) by a continuous or<br /> batch process employed in industrial installations using distillates of subheading Nos 2710 00, 2711 11, 2711 12<br /> to 2711 19, 2711 21 and 2711 29 (other than propane of a purity of 99 % or more) to obtain:<br /> 1.  isolated high-purity hydrocarbons (90 % or more in the case of olefins and 95 % or more in the case of<br /> other hydrocarbons), mixtures of isomers having the same organic composition being regarded as isolated<br /> hydrocarbons;<br /> only those process by means of which at least three different products are obtained are admissible, but this<br /> restriction does not apply in any instance where the process consists in the separation of isomers. In so far<br /> this concerns xylenes, ethylbenzene is included with xylene isomers;<br /> 2.  Products of subheading Nos 2707 10 to 2707 30, 2707 50 and 2710 00:<br /> (a)  with no overlapping of the final boiling point of one fraction and the initial boiling point of the<br /> succeeding fraction and a difference of not more than 60 \u00b0C between the temperatures at which 5 and<br /> 90 % by the volume (including losses) distil by the ASTM D 86-67 method (reapproved 1972);<br /> (b)  with an overlapping of the final boiling point of one fraction and the initial boiling point of the<br /> succeeding fraction and a difference of not more than 30 \u00b0C between the temperatures at which 5 and<br /> 90 % by volume (including losses) distil by the ASTM D 86-67 method (reapproved 1972).", "ShowProductAffected": false, "ProductAffected": null, "RevisionName": null, "Rank": 0, "ShowRooExceptions": false, "RooExceptions": null}], "SpecificNote": [{"RooCode": null, "RooText": null, "ShowProductAffected": false, "ProductAffected": null, "RevisionName": null, "Rank": 0, "ShowRooExceptions": false, "RooExceptions": null}], "Documents": [{"DocDesc": "Certificate of origin", "DocFileName": "itc00393_coo.pdf", "DocType": "1_coo", "WebLink": "http://www.sice.oas.org/Trade/MEX_EU/English/Decisions_Council/Dec2_Annexes_e/Annex_3_App3_e.pdf"}, {"DocDesc": "Product-specific rules of origin", "DocFileName": "itc00393_sroo.pdf", "DocType": "2_sroo", "WebLink": "http://www.sice.oas.org/Trade/MEX_EU/English/Decisions_Council/Dec2_Annexes_e/Annex_3_App2a_e.pdf"}, {"DocDesc": "Chapter on rules of origin", "DocFileName": "itc00393_roo.pdf", "DocType": "3_roo", "WebLink": "http://www.sice.oas.org/Trade/MEX_EU/English/Decisions_Council/Dec2_Annexes_e/Annex_3_e.pdf"}, {"DocDesc": "Full text of agreement", "DocFileName": "itc00393_full.pdf", "DocType": "8_full", "WebLink": "https://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar:f95ad1a3-795e-4fb0-84e1-28351b99415c.0004.02/DOC_2&format=PDF"}]}, "FtaProvisions": {"RooProvision": [{"ProvisionAbbrev": "accum", "ProvisionCode": "Cumulation", "ProvisionValue": "bilateral", "ProvisionRank": null, "ProvisionGlossary": "A provision which allows to consider goods obtained in as well as processing taking place in one FTA member country as originating in another.", "ProvisionGlossaryLink": "/en/glossary?uid=accum&returnto=gloscenter", "ProvisionLegalExtract": "Article 3 : Bilateral cumulation of origin <br /> 1 Materials originating in the Community shall be considered as materials originating in Mexico when incorporated <br /> into a product obtained there.

The first column<br /> gives the chapter number, heading number or sub-heading number used in the<br /> Harmonized System and the second column gives the description of goods used<br /> in that system for that chapter, heading or sub-heading. For each entry in the<br /> first two columns a rule is specified in columns 3 or 4. Where, in some cases,<br /> the entry in the first column is preceded by an 'ex', this signifies that the rules in<br /> columns 3 or 4 apply only to the part of that chapter which is not described<br /> below in column 2.<br /> 2.2 Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns<br /> 3 and 4, the exporter may opt, as an alternative, to apply either the rule set out in<br /> column 3 or that set out in column 4.

or <br /> (b) a certificate or any other information given by <br /> the customs authorities of such one or more <br /> Parties or non-Parties, or other relevant <br /> entities, which proves that the good has not <br /> undergone operations other than unloading, <br /> reloading and any other operation to preserve it <br /> in good condition in those Parties or non-Parties. <br /> 4 (a) Notwithstanding paragraph 5 of Rule 2, where an <br /> originating good, for which a CO (hereinafter <br /> referred to in this paragraph as \"original CO\") <br /> was issued by the competent governmental <br /> authority or its designees of the exporting <br /> Party, is to be exported from the importing Party <br /> to another Party, the competent governmental <br /> authority or its designees of the importing Party <br /> may issue a back-to-back CO as a new CO for the <br /> originating good, if a request is made by the <br /> exporter in the importing Party or its authorised <br /> agent with presentation of the valid original CO. <br /> (b) Where a back-to-back CO is issued in accordance <br /> with subparagraph (a), \"an originating good of <br /> the exporting Party\" referred to in Chapter 3 and <br /> this Annex shall be construed as an originating <br /> good of the Party whose competent governmental <br /> authority or its designees has issued the original CO. <br /> Rule 1 : Application for Certificate of Origin <br /> (a) An application for a Certificate of Origin (hereinafter referred to as <br /> \"CO\") is to be made by the exporter or its authorised agent to the <br /> competent governmental authority of the exporting Party or its <br /> designees referred to in paragraph 1 of Rule 2 of the Operational <br /> Certification Procedures (hereinafter referred to as \"OCP\") set out <br /> in Annex 4 of the Agreement on Comprehensive Economic <br /> Partnership among Member States of the Association of Southeast <br /> Asian Nations and Japan (hereinafter referred to as \"AJCEP <br /> Agreement\"), together with supporting documents proving that the <br /> good to be exported qualifies for the issuance of a CO, in <br /> accordance with the exporting Party's domestic laws and regulations. <br /> (b) Where a pre-exportation examination of the origin of a good to be <br /> exported is conducted, the result of the examination, subject to <br /> review periodically or whenever appropriate, will be accepted as the <br /> supporting evidence in determining the origin of the good to be <br /> exported thereafter. The pre-exportation examination may not apply <br /> to the good the origin of which, by its nature, can be easily determined. <br /> Rule 2 : Issuance of the Certificate of Origin <br /> The competent governmental authority of the exporting Party or its designees is, <br /> to the best of its competence and ability, required to carry out proper examination, <br /> in accordance with the domestic laws and regulations of the exporting Party, <br /> upon each application for a CO to ensure that: <br /> (a) the CO is duly completed and signed by the authorised signatory; <br /> (b) the origin of the good is in conformity with Chapter 3 of the AJCEP Agreement; <br /> (c) the description, quantity (e.g. gross weight, net weight) of the good, <br /> marks and numbers of packages, and number and kinds of <br /> packages, as specified, conform to the good; and <br /> (d) other statements in the CO correspond to relevant supporting documents submitted. <br /> Rule 3 : Format of Certificate of Origin <br /> (a) A CO should be on A4 size paper. <br /> (b) A CO will comprise the original and two (2) copies in the case of a <br /> Party which is an ASEAN Member State, and only the original in the case of Japan. <br /> (c) A CO will bear a reference number separately given by each place or office of issuance. <br /> (d) For cases where there is a third country invoice, this is to be <br /> indicated in the CO, together with such information as the name <br /> and address of the person issuing the invoice. <br /> (e) A declaration for a CO is to be completed by the exporter, in box 11 <br /> of the ASEAN Member States' form and box 10 of Japan's form. <br /> The exporter's signature may be autographed or electronically printed. <br /> (f) Signatures on a CO of the authorised signatory of the competent <br /> governmental authority of the exporting Party or its designees may <br /> be autographed or electronically printed. <br /> (g) The original of a CO is to be forwarded by the exporter to the <br /> importer for submission to the customs authority of the importing <br /> Party. In the case of a Party which is an ASEAN Member State, a <br /> copy of the CO is to be retained by both the exporter and the <br /> competent governmental authority of the exporting Party or its designees, respectively. <br /> Multiple Items or Invoices <br /> (h) A CO, which indicates two or more invoices issued for a single <br /> shipment, will be accepted by the customs authority of the importing Party. <br /> (i) Multiple items declared on the same CO should be allowed, <br /> provided that each item qualifies as an originating good separately in its own right. <br /> (j) For multiple items declared on the same CO, a problem <br /> encountered with one or more of the items declared will not affect <br /> or delay the preferential tariff treatment and customs clearance of <br /> the remaining items declared on that CO. Paragraph 5 of Rule 6 of <br /> the OCP may be applied to the problematic items. <br /> Rule 9 : Back-to-back CO for Partial Export Shipments <br /> For the purpose of subparagraph 4(a) of Rule 3 of the OCP, in the case of partial <br /> export shipments, the partial export value and partial quantity is to be shown on <br /> the back-to-back CO. The Party issuing the back-to-back CO is required to <br /> ensure that the total quantity exported under the partial shipment does not <br /> exceed the total quantity shown in the original CO. <br /> Rule 13 : Procedure to exchange the sample of a certificate of origin, specimen signatures and official seals <br /> Each Party is required to provide the other Parties, through the ASEAN <br /> Secretariat, with a sample of a CO, specimen signatures and specimen official <br /> seals or impressions of stamps of its competent governmental authority or its <br /> designees for the issuance of a CO, upon the date of adoption of this <br /> Implementing Regulations, as well as, in case of any subsequent modification <br /> thereof, thirty (30) days before the modification is made.", "ProvisionValueCssClass": "", "ProvisionDisplayCssClass": null}, {"ProvisionAbbrev": "exmptcoo", "ProvisionCode": "Exemption of certification", "ProvisionValue": "included (less than JPY 200000 or USD 200)", "ProvisionRank": null, "ProvisionGlossary": "A provision which lists exemptions from the requirement to provide a proof of origin.

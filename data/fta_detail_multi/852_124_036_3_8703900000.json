The importing <br /> Party shall complete the verification, including any additional request to the <br /> exporter or producer under paragraph 1(b) or 1(c), within the time provided in paragraph 6(e). [6] <br /> 4. A written request for information or for a verification visit under <br /> paragraphs 1(a) through 1(c) shall: <br /> (a) be in English or in an official language of the Party of the person to <br /> whom the request is made; <br /> (b) include the identity of the government authority issuing the request; <br /> (c) state the reason for the request, including the specific issue the <br /> requesting Party seeks to resolve with the verification; <br /> (d) include sufficient information to identify the good that is being verified; <br /> (e) include a copy of relevant information submitted with the good, <br /> including the certification of origin; and <br /> (f) in the case of a verification visit, request the written consent of the <br /> exporter or producer whose premises are going to be visited, and <br /> state the proposed date and location for the visit and its specific purpose. <br /> 5. If an importing Party has initiated a verification in accordance with <br /> paragraph 1(b) or 1(c), it shall inform the importer of the initiation of the verification. <br /> 6. For a verification under paragraphs 1(a) through 1(c), the importing Party shall: <br /> (a) ensure that a written request for information, or for documentation <br /> to be reviewed during a verification visit, is limited to information <br /> and documentation to determine whether the good is originating; <br /> (b) describe the information or documentation in sufficient detail to <br /> allow the importer, exporter or producer to identify the information <br /> and documentation necessary to respond; <br /> (c) allow the importer, exporter or producer at least 30 days from the <br /> date of receipt of the written request for information under <br /> paragraph 1(a) or 1(b) to respond; <br /> (d) allow the exporter or producer 30 days from the date of receipt of <br /> the written request for a visit under paragraph 1(c) to consent or refuse the request; and <br /> (e) make a determination following a verification as expeditiously as <br /> possible and no later than 90 days after it receives the information <br /> necessary to make the determination, including, if applicable, any <br /> information received under paragraph 9, and no later than 365 days <br /> after the first request for information or other action under <br /> paragraph 1. If permitted by its law, a Party may extend the 365 <br /> day period in exceptional cases, such as where the technical <br /> information concerned is very complex. <br /> 7. If an importing Party makes a verification request under paragraph 1(b), it <br /> shall, on request of the Party where the exporter or producer is located and in <br /> accordance with the importing Party's laws and regulations, inform that Party. <br /> The Parties concerned shall decide the manner and timing of informing the Party <br /> where the exporter or producer is located of the verification request. In addition, <br /> on request of the importing Party, the Party where the exporter or producer is <br /> located may, as it deems appropriate and in accordance with its laws and <br /> regulations, assist with the verification. This assistance may include providing a <br /> contact point for the verification, collecting information from the exporter or <br /> producer on behalf of the importing Party, or other activities in order that the <br /> importing Party may make a determination as to whether the good is originating. <br /> The importing Party shall not deny a claim for preferential tariff treatment solely <br /> on the ground that the Party where the exporter or producer is located did not <br /> provide requested assistance. <br /> 8. If an importing Party initiates a verification under paragraph 1(c), it shall, <br /> at the time of the request for the visit, inform the Party where the exporter or <br /> producer is located and provide the opportunity for the officials of the Party where <br /> the exporter or producer is located to accompany them during the visit. <br /> 9. Prior to issuing a written determination, the importing Party shall inform <br /> the importer and any exporter or producer that provided information directly to <br /> the importing Party, of the results of the verification and, if the importing Party <br /> intends to deny preferential tariff treatment, provide those persons a period of at <br /> least 30 days for the submission of additional information relating to the origin of the good. <br /> 10. The importing Party shall: <br /> (a) provide the importer with a written determination of whether the <br /> good is originating that includes the basis for the determination; and <br /> (b) provide the importer, exporter or producer that provided <br /> information during the verification or certified that the good was <br /> originating with the results of the verification and the reasons for that result. <br /> 11. During verification, the importing Party shall allow the release of the <br /> good, subject to payment of duties or provision of security as provided for in its <br /> law. If as a result of the verification the importing Party determines that the good <br /> is an originating good, it shall grant preferential tariff treatment to the good and <br /> refund any excess duties paid or release any security provided, unless the security <br /> also covers other obligations. <br /> 12. If verifications of identical goods by a Party indicate a pattern of conduct <br /> by an importer, exporter or producer of false or unsupported representations <br /> relevant to a claim that a good imported into its territory qualifies as an <br /> originating good, the Party may withhold preferential tariff treatment to identical <br /> goods imported, exported or produced by that person until that person <br /> demonstrates that the identical goods qualify as originating. For the purposes of <br /> this paragraph, \"identical goods\" means goods that are the same in all respects <br /> relevant to the particular rule of origin that qualifies the goods as originating. <br /> 13. For the purpose of a verification request, it is sufficient for a Party to rely <br /> on the contact information of an exporter, producer or importer in a Party <br /> provided in a certification of origin. <br /> [5] For the purposes of this Article, the information collected in accordance with this Article shall be <br /> used for the purpose of ensuring the effective implementation of this Chapter. A Party shall not use <br /> these procedures to collect information for other purposes. <br /> [6] For greater certainty, a Party is not required to request information from the exporter or producer <br /> to support a claim for preferential tariff treatment or complete a verification through the exporter <br /> or producer if the claim for preferential tariff treatment is based on the importer's certification of origin. <br /> Article 3.28: Determinations on Claims for Preferential Tariff Treatment <br /> 1. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph 2 or Article 4.7 <br /> (Determinations), each Party shall grant a claim for preferential tariff treatment <br /> made in accordance with this Chapter for a good that arrives in its territory on or <br /> after the date of entry into force of this Agreement for that Party. In addition, if <br /> permitted by the importing Party, the importing Party shall grant a claim for <br /> preferential tariff treatment made in accordance with this Chapter for a good <br /> which is imported into its territory or released from customs control on or after the <br /> date of entry into force of this Agreement for that Party. <br /> 2. The importing Party may deny a claim for preferential tariff treatment if: <br /> (a) it determines that the good does not qualify for preferential treatment; <br /> (b) pursuant to a verification under Article 3.27 (Verification of <br /> Origin), it has not received sufficient information to determine that <br /> the good qualifies as originating; <br /> (c) the exporter, producer or importer fails to respond to a written <br /> request for information in accordance with Article 3.27 (Verification of Origin); <br /> (d) after receipt of a written notification for a verification visit, the <br /> exporter or producer does not provide its written consent in <br /> accordance with Article 3.27 (Verification of Origin); or <br /> (e) the importer, exporter or producer fails to comply with the <br /> requirements of this Chapter. <br /> 3. If an importing Party denies a claim for preferential tariff treatment, it <br /> shall issue a determination to the importer that includes the reasons for the determination. <br /> 4. A Party shall not reject a claim for preferential tariff treatment for the sole <br /> reason that the invoice was issued in a non-Party.
